The LLM answer implies multiple slices, whereas the ground truth specifies a singular slice."
"When mincing a specific fruit or vegetable, where should the knife be placed - in the middle or at the end of the object?",End,"At the top or bottom, on the round portion.","False   The LLM answer does not align with the ground truth. The ground truth states the knife should be placed at the ""end"" of the object, whereas the LLM answer suggests placing the knife at the ""top or bottom, on the round portion"", which is not the same as the end."
"When mincing a specific fruit or vegetable, what other cutting task - if any - should be executed before?",Julienning,Cut into slices or halves.,"False   The LLM answer does not align with the ground truth. Julienning is a specific cutting task that involves cutting ingredients into thin strips, typically after they have been cut into a larger shape, such as a baton or stick. The LLM answer suggests cutting into slices or halves, which is not the same as Julienning."
"When mincing a specific fruit or vegetable, how many cuts need to be made - exactly one or more than one?",at least 1,More than one.,"True   The LLM answer ""More than one"" aligns with the ground truth ""at least 1"" since making more than one cut implies that at least one cut is made."
"When mincing a specific fruit or vegetable, what is form of the input to perform the action on?",Stripe,Fresh fruit or vegetable,"False   The LLM answer does not align with the ground truth. The ground truth states that the form of the input is a ""Stripe"", whereas the LLM answer states it is ""Fresh fruit or vegetable"". These are not the same, so the result is False."

"When chopping a specific fruit or vegetable, what other cutting task - if any - should be executed before?",Julienning,Remove any seeds or stems.,"False   The LLM answer does not align with the ground truth. Julienning refers to cutting ingredients into thin strips, often before chopping or dicing. Removing seeds or stems is a different task that may be performed before chopping, but it is not the same as Julienning."
"When chopping a specific fruit or vegetable, how many cuts need to be made - exactly one or more than one?",at least 1,More than one.,"True   The LLM answer ""More than one"" aligns with the ground truth ""at least 1"" because making more than one cut implies that at least one cut is made. The ground truth does not specify that only one cut can be made, so both ""exactly one"" and ""more than one"" are compatible with ""at least 1""."
"When chopping a specific fruit or vegetable, what is form of the input to perform the action on?",Stripe,Chunks or slices.,"False   The LLM answer does not align with the ground truth. The ground truth states that the form of the input is a ""Stripe"", whereas the LLM answer mentions ""Chunks or slices"", which are different forms."
"When chopping a specific fruit or vegetable, what is form and amount of the resulting pieces?",1 Cube and 1 Stripe,"Chunky and equally sized, allowing 2 pieces per bowl.","False   The LLM answer does not match the ground truth. The ground truth specifies the form and amount of the resulting pieces as ""1 Cube and 1 Stripe"", whereas the LLM answer describes the pieces as ""Chunky and equally sized"" and mentions the quantity as ""2 pieces per bowl"", which does not align with the ground truth."
