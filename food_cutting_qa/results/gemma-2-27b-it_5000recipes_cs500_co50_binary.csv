"When carving a specific fruit or vegetable, where should the knife be placed - in the middle or at the end of the object?",End,At the end.,True
"When carving a specific fruit or vegetable, how many cuts need to be made - exactly one or more than one?",exactly 1,More than one.,False
"When carving a specific fruit or vegetable, what is form of the input to perform the action on?",Whole or FoodPart,Whole fruit or vegetable,"True 

The LLM answer ""Whole fruit or vegetable"" aligns with the ground truth ""Whole or FoodPart"" as it specifies that the input for carving is a whole fruit or vegetable, which falls under the category of ""Whole"" or a part of food, hence ""FoodPart""."
"When carving a specific fruit or vegetable, what is form and amount of the resulting pieces?",1 FoodPart and 1 Slice,Dice into 1 1/2 inch chunks.,"False 

The LLM answer does not align with the ground truth. The ground truth specifies that the result of carving is 1 FoodPart and 1 Slice, whereas the LLM answer describes dicing into 1 1/2 inch chunks, which is a different form and amount of resulting pieces."
"When mincing a specific fruit or vegetable, where should the knife be placed - in the middle or at the end of the object?",End,At the end.,True
"When mincing a specific fruit or vegetable, what other cutting task - if any - should be executed before?",Julienning,Peeling.,"False 

The ground truth answer is Julienning, which refers to cutting into thin strips, often after dicing or mincing has been done to create uniform strips. However, the LLM answer provided is Peeling, which is a different cutting task that involves removing the outer layer of a fruit or vegetable. While peeling might be done before mincing for some items, it's not the specific task that directly precedes mincing in the context of preparing ingredients for cooking, especially when considering the sequence of operations like peeling, chopping, dicing, and then possibly julienning for specific recipes."
"When mincing a specific fruit or vegetable, how many cuts need to be made - exactly one or more than one?",at least 1,More than one.,"True 

The LLM answer ""More than one"" aligns with the ground truth ""at least 1"" since making more than one cut implies that at least one cut is made."
"When mincing a specific fruit or vegetable, what is form of the input to perform the action on?",Stripe,"Whole, unminced pieces.","False 

The LLM answer does not align with the ground truth. The ground truth states that the form of the input is a ""Stripe"", but the LLM answer states that it is ""Whole, unminced pieces"". These are two different forms, so the LLM answer does not match the ground truth."
"When mincing a specific fruit or vegetable, what is form and amount of the resulting pieces?",1 Cube and 1 Stripe,"Very small, finely chopped pieces.","False 

The LLM answer does not match the ground truth, which specifies the form and amount of the resulting pieces as ""1 Cube and 1 Stripe"". The LLM answer provides a general description of the size and texture of the pieces, but does not provide the specific form and amount."

"When cubing a specific fruit or vegetable, what other cutting task - if any - should be executed before?",Julienning,Cutting lengthwise and seeding.,"False 

The ground truth answer is ""Julienning"", which refers to cutting into thin strips, but the LLM answer mentions ""cutting lengthwise and seeding"", which is not the same as Julienning. Julienning is typically done before cubing to create uniform strips that can then be cut into cubes."
"When cubing a specific fruit or vegetable, how many cuts need to be made - exactly one or more than one?",at least 1,More than one.,True
"When cubing a specific fruit or vegetable, what is form of the input to perform the action on?",Stripe,Fruit cubes,"False 

The ground truth answer is ""Stripe"" but the LLM answer is ""Fruit cubes"", which does not align with the ground truth."
"When cubing a specific fruit or vegetable, what is form and amount of the resulting pieces?",1 Cube and 1 Stripe,Small cubes.,"False 

The LLM answer ""Small cubes"" does not match the ground truth ""1 Cube and 1 Stripe"". The ground truth seems to be referring to a specific outcome of cubing a particular fruit or vegetable, possibly a specific type like a carrot or beet, where one might get a cube and a stripe (perhaps from the skin), but the LLM's answer is too general and does not account for the ""stripe"" part of the ground truth."
"When chopping a specific fruit or vegetable, where should the knife be placed - in the middle or at the end of the object?",End,At the end.,True
"When chopping a specific fruit or vegetable, what other cutting task - if any - should be executed before?",Julienning,Core the apples.,"False 

The ground truth answer is ""Julienning"", which refers to cutting into thin strips, typically for vegetables. The LLM answer ""Core the apples"" is a different cutting task, specific to preparing apples, and does not match the ground truth."
"When chopping a specific fruit or vegetable, how many cuts need to be made - exactly one or more than one?",at least 1,More than one.,"True 

The LLM answer ""More than one"" aligns with the ground truth ""at least 1"" because making more than one cut implies that at least one cut is made. The ground truth does not specify that only one cut can be made, so both ""exactly one"" and ""more than one"" are compatible with ""at least 1""."
"When chopping a specific fruit or vegetable, what is form of the input to perform the action on?",Stripe,Chopped,"False 

The LLM answer ""Chopped"" describes the result of the action, whereas the ground truth ""Stripe"" describes the form of the input to perform the action on, which in this context likely refers to the shape or pattern in which the fruit or vegetable is cut."
"When chopping a specific fruit or vegetable, what is form and amount of the resulting pieces?",1 Cube and 1 Stripe,Chopped.,"False 

The LLM answer ""Chopped"" does not provide specific information about the form and amount of the resulting pieces, whereas the ground truth answer ""1 Cube and 1 Stripe"" does."
"When dividing a specific fruit or vegetable, where should the knife be placed - in the middle or at the end of the object?",Middle,Follow the curve of the object.,"False

The LLM answer does not directly align with the ground truth, which specifies that the knife should be placed in the middle of the fruit or vegetable. The LLM answer provides a more general guideline that may not necessarily result in the knife being placed in the middle."
"When dividing a specific fruit or vegetable, how many cuts need to be made - exactly one or more than one?",exactly 1,More than one.,False
"When dividing a specific fruit or vegetable, what is form of the input to perform the action on?",Whole,Fruit,"False 

The ground truth answer is ""Whole"", indicating that the input to perform the action of dividing is a whole fruit or vegetable. The LLM answer ""Fruit"" does not align with this, as it is too general and does not specify that the fruit needs to be whole."
"When dividing a specific fruit or vegetable, what is form and amount of the resulting pieces?",2 Halve,"Fruit is segmented, vegetables are halved or sliced.","False 

The LLM answer does not align with the ground truth, which specifically states that the result of dividing a specific fruit or vegetable is 2 halves. The LLM answer provides a more general response that includes various methods of division (segmented, halved, sliced) and distinguishes between fruits and vegetables, rather than providing a uniform outcome of ""2 halves"" as stated in the ground truth."
