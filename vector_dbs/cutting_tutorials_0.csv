That's another way to eat it raw and they can be tossed in a salad like that.",-0.003195448,0.060342964,0.044477586,-0.0038874706,0.0093095815,-0.09865417,-0.06602561,0.006852747,-0.07279434,0.0024481157,0.04907948,-0.03269284,-0.0779832,-0.06998366,-0.028164692,-0.05164932,0.015292389,0.09145517,-0.08145433,-0.015347818,0.084236935,0.056728028,0.0002470328,-0.029049957,0.022109985,-0.0042841663,-0.030418122,0.026214657,-0.0025239442,-0.06484464,0.09202737,0.035336945,0.0075532417,0.0046385997,-0.045040328,0.008170201,-0.06109074,-0.048304837,0.09839112,-0.0661913,0.10993931,0.061023872,0.003674072,-0.038378228,0.0023664252,-0.061628405,-0.03327465,-0.008481139,0.083317444,-0.0144624915,0.028814962,-0.051862214,-0.11088874,-0.038615305,-0.052083787,-0.016399166,0.019846493,-0.07231922,0.02827815,0.043102864,0.068288386,-0.0077802306,0.00393378,-0.008116743,-0.025087567,-0.050625935,0.011909467,-0.0013640472,-0.016464157,-0.0021419418,-0.014008865,-0.036197055,-0.049354892,0.019862559,-0.1280815,0.0106721455,-0.04692187,-0.053353235,-0.057802137,0.121700116,-0.03556271,0.0078089843,0.06863747,0.03796278,0.006256384,0.09990776,-0.033164896,-0.022425663,0.007878773,0.08391989,-0.03881603,0.04557448,0.010833541,0.0131392535,-0.07411118,0.030759579,0.059141487,-0.030247381,-0.004884754,0.052121226,-0.045438703,-0.073385395,0.0109095,-0.16912588,-0.13441707,-0.071159475,-0.015931284,-0.050159283,8.492442e-05,-0.087300375,-0.04208367,0.033346217,-0.041315176,-0.10253218,0.012670844,0.006231055,0.08249485,-0.021725228,0.02518819,0.01889329,-0.03199697,-0.017553838,-0.02776674,0.0012858246,0.014925359,0.0061392034,0.122686386,2.1597664e-33,-0.018425215,0.109701715,-0.0008891002,-0.01892292,0.09189066,-0.0067921956,-0.0066766446,-0.03967254,-0.038554363,0.004070478,-0.01529057,-0.08275921,-0.030246658,-0.053762738,-0.0022948273,-0.017056882,0.03567771,-0.081007354,0.007011263,-0.033465866,0.08207554,-0.010376967,0.0091244755,-0.049215615,0.041174013,-0.05035377,-0.028272219,-0.051966034,0.04741129,0.017959362,0.06556105,0.032698993,-0.060458817,0.054658126,-0.08939478,0.04842463,0.016965628,0.012006256,0.011508625,0.010065999,0.013886742,0.047588333,0.025872076,0.043824706,-0.040219378,-0.020186936,0.0029573492,0.08733214,0.055304047,0.03650334,0.07268812,0.006841052,0.12747401,-0.032973006,-0.01589291,0.030730981,0.07265195,0.0070984475,-0.015492745,0.032543123,0.1160934,-0.014122904,-0.025549084,0.016800892,-0.024381703,0.03931815,-0.10171828,0.03891853,-0.02929287,-0.12965776,-0.094312355,0.02393766,0.08414897,-0.05459195,-0.0594343,0.0117139965,0.020325331,0.00836061,0.037225086,-0.024365298,0.04421182,0.109078944,0.013203453,-0.0060719787,0.034317046,0.024717866,-0.06278914,0.07920122,0.046355806,-0.042137433,-0.012553265,-0.033398397,-0.022596726,-0.0074440134,-0.0203267,-1.6469445e-33,0.08075755,0.041773193,-0.037016235,0.063239135,0.042425603,0.001994749,-0.046940524,0.06861004,-0.06409772,-0.019217135,-0.08341703,-0.07114467,0.02103607,-0.01951936,0.0039124154,-0.005605243,0.08557313,0.10315277,-0.050836634,-0.05818745,-0.061276983,0.010304789,0.052492518,-0.05122634,-0.023885418,-0.014787093,0.04427896,0.015121162,-0.027143078,0.02475764,0.07109676,-0.050084967,0.07058111,-0.09289452,-0.028031977,0.062468715,-0.02980627,-0.03566845,0.1263021,0.030962443,0.0066757984,-0.06691683,-0.04098965,0.040202487,0.040005945,-0.08124516,-0.012144935,-0.053188194,-0.06344788,-0.0073281312,0.04453937,0.021895062,-0.053369164,0.054873206,0.0013808815,-0.05673879,0.008844222,-0.0035764063,0.026949724,-0.0551769,-0.057599768,0.011554939,-0.007289113,0.08076401,0.037649523,0.0073224297,-0.039935257,0.012054779,-0.07723098,0.051479097,-0.06799099,0.015223645,-0.06007883,-0.02832612,0.11178158,-0.06563002,-0.0065253978,-0.0043163914,0.0013446067,0.054694083,0.032338973,-0.059346806,0.014597436,-0.031277858,0.06901532,-0.02595528,-0.06670293,0.021748785,-0.035186734,-0.07792255,-0.047938082,-0.03155224,0.04385314,0.09933567,0.097399905,-4.6716337e-08,0.07483234,-0.042918157,0.011341843,0.081039876,0.022417106,0.031881616,-0.021722252,0.014867729,0.09670076,-0.0144209815,-0.048757643,0.021587018,-0.0017927482,0.032644834,0.00927788,0.015722642,0.05455039,0.10245885,0.0013766031,0.05466001,-0.06096646,0.011132665,0.060941868,-0.03711164,0.07155984,-0.036160436,-0.034471188,-0.02990369,0.021542754,0.06880583,-0.042122547,0.0021625387,-0.038271345,0.039467275,-0.021840109,0.020453468,-0.07412112,0.042518977,-0.0070581306,0.060561176,-0.0069461614,-0.053607512,-0.0036217766,0.026885418,-0.039892156,-0.0125766,0.040594626,0.021427551,0.0121067455,0.09474191,0.0831071,-0.030526852,0.016802905,-0.016661197,-0.03256026,-0.031084882,0.089833826,0.03676752,-0.024362508,0.040519103,-0.0066329422,0.022132017,0.005558705,0.035418235
"Peas, peas are a spring vegetable and they're one of the vegetables that you really need to eat freshly picked. They get starchy and lack sweetness when they've been sitting around for a while.
The way you shell a pea is you don't need a knife or anything else, you just pop the end like that, run your thumb along the edge and then you reveal all the peas.

"Take off the end and then thinly slice it. [knife tapping against wooden board] like that, I leave them home to roast with the skin on and then you can have fun squeezing it out to eat it and it's a much mellower, softer flavor.
It's not as pungent at all. The other way is to finally dice it [knife tapping against wooden board] and I just go like this in half sliced and go like that.",0.08385094,0.011117343,0.0019121418,-5.7302695e-05,-0.04806607,-0.0896831,0.066465095,0.010448638,-0.050828785,0.0030607134,0.00044785553,-0.0494246,-0.14722334,0.04825308,-0.022248492,-0.057165023,0.049206235,-0.04320711,0.020980742,-0.023893924,0.10599937,-0.0029721032,0.02117869,0.0041767927,0.03340817,-0.01786842,0.070077546,-0.007983264,-0.0478527,-0.045129687,0.11390637,-0.042194698,0.013746118,-0.021012237,-0.027214937,-0.013023353,0.010287152,0.03150981,0.10950451,-0.0124745155,0.10624748,0.038793854,0.012634615,0.033354737,0.033089623,0.005860718,-0.030036593,-0.024241418,0.117050774,0.0270157,-0.055791527,-0.100462295,-0.055206034,-0.007307286,-0.07569431,0.02757042,-0.010899096,0.0032707714,0.038109895,0.009762377,-0.0139020365,0.002675625,0.009795878,-0.012851817,0.017776448,-0.09687899,0.049622267,0.012577915,-0.046897843,0.059384935,-0.010092003,0.040154446,-0.037480183,-0.0039369734,-0.02989992,-0.020116203,0.021129139,-0.019695183,-0.031310517,0.08151723,-0.13013181,-0.0029848567,0.050236255,0.09425568,-0.061838344,0.078705214,0.0148752155,-0.043020975,0.06661206,-0.034278207,0.048816945,0.087370865,0.029561788,0.025708295,0.013425369,-0.026146537,0.014648822,0.01837566,-0.022944467,0.031515338,-0.05001251,-0.05025834,-0.006257972,-0.12647678,-0.050890222,-0.023655495,-0.045296326,0.025313865,0.05480946,-0.033499658,-0.010919565,0.07416659,0.008118889,-0.046143446,-0.015526114,0.036524255,0.07258947,0.028265838,-0.0013926119,-0.0061007417,-0.014311581,-0.030850036,-0.039192684,0.06035776,-0.024409229,0.017769655,0.13937275,2.024021e-34,-0.05316688,0.10491401,-0.02384641,-0.088469446,0.049956717,-0.055237055,-0.01991169,0.0038778118,-0.055022787,0.0783964,0.016245794,-0.09518442,-0.048016917,0.002770975,0.008538556,-0.084844016,-0.033299796,-0.053615957,0.0074389093,0.009612179,0.013214397,0.046777975,0.045182742,0.0034748693,-0.041522395,-0.01724576,-0.025826508,-0.02333083,0.029868074,0.029738702,0.095179744,-0.038850866,-0.051541336,-0.024159439,-0.06799262,0.06168161,0.016765233,0.038683288,-0.016346892,-0.041918285,0.0012021699,-0.012633992,0.027195085,0.04287411,-0.055686664,-0.042138193,0.008973211,0.11531007,0.035093594,0.010195901,0.070256606,0.03442152,0.12701337,0.016588459,-0.06550565,-0.03973367,0.108973995,-0.04000423,0.011969152,-0.012800351,0.08247615,-0.0074316864,-0.009754311,0.058256734,-0.034893874,0.00999477,-0.0059203976,0.02850791,0.030549027,-0.086527355,-0.073009655,0.008404587,0.03342757,-0.07431761,-0.14513023,-0.019708114,0.003540912,-0.027051179,0.058167838,-0.0638898,0.0051874234,0.010837605,-0.047968633,-0.02375999,-0.024924794,0.0012070114,-0.05698381,0.028337797,0.06117526,0.0044492586,-0.06771001,-0.027857384,-0.0038679205,-0.016135763,0.01824439,-2.5811558e-34,0.033066604,-0.0073486194,-0.051563885,0.11883759,-0.03495867,-0.0050831884,0.019886317,0.0460532,-0.06590851,-0.08623513,-0.06792271,-0.003371726,0.0048411232,0.023898626,-0.013389983,0.111315265,0.04894162,0.15246795,-0.00060750206,-0.08944251,-0.03973486,-0.025615294,0.042028222,0.07400916,0.02115276,0.027258556,0.0992098,-0.010193194,0.0013129852,-0.037905656,0.050153635,-0.085290186,0.05640173,-0.14537099,-0.04016887,0.116641134,-0.012086856,0.054466747,0.06684358,-0.023743674,-0.025605723,-0.037338637,-0.07913375,0.040451806,-0.041041195,0.006607072,0.002226024,0.037414815,-0.06557039,0.104794316,0.056051478,0.011209105,0.01638177,-0.039666455,-0.035432454,0.007377347,-0.005967964,-0.06310025,-0.009720186,-0.028570939,-0.07497947,0.058309805,0.040005717,-0.013403537,0.04965354,-0.043483112,-0.07317912,-0.015284979,0.00020550404,-0.0064725783,-0.07741266,0.049971074,0.0014243956,-0.025456777,0.037775576,0.0022575478,0.026586495,-0.023749033,-0.035355203,0.038949624,0.043627042,-0.037887573,0.0630592,-0.009078258,0.026377052,-0.0036977218,-0.023504253,0.065939665,-0.035417624,-0.00631637,-0.008774853,-0.028188804,0.09216887,0.066197984,0.07064667,-4.2653806e-08,0.04635389,-0.07007167,0.06876564,0.028402315,0.006034168,0.062323622,-0.03420973,-0.036344074,-0.02703503,-0.060663413,-0.07491532,0.067905396,-0.03776512,0.12464534,-0.020690667,0.05085301,0.00836899,0.056682564,-0.038699474,0.01813476,-0.04895212,-0.05513113,0.07130666,-0.039440606,0.01917003,-0.054274052,-0.0839455,0.048081342,0.010194259,0.03920977,-0.00049107725,0.0455815,-0.0692126,0.017639155,-0.012852561,0.04337685,-0.027149789,0.016224436,-0.009185084,0.033084203,-0.05463185,-0.057750374,-0.03138612,0.021475654,-0.10598255,-0.052547876,-0.0037080587,0.0094153145,-0.025650581,0.12892655,0.055611897,-0.027487764,-0.04390762,0.042365335,-0.07103529,-0.034288432,0.03317848,-0.048381396,0.012030124,-0.0002650266,0.027138874,0.0063542896,0.004912632,-0.017228065
"[upbeat trumpet music] Shallot, a shallot is a member of the onion family. It can also be used in place of onions. A lot of people prefer it. 
I would just cut off the root end and then just score down the full length of the shallot with a knife and peel off the outer layer.

"Watercress, watercress grows in water. It is delicious, juicy and quite peppery. I love it raw in salads the most. I think it adds such a delicious sort of punchy flavor. 
And you can just pluck off the leaves like that and of course this is edible too, it's juicy and delicious. If you did wanna cook it, chop it up like this and just saute it.",-0.024622543,-0.026646975,-0.024302907,0.04732799,0.06052781,0.010026063,0.09106317,0.013743139,-0.0068454985,-0.0069027403,0.015494513,-0.081756376,0.010105886,-0.055717703,-0.13494764,-0.09392399,0.08502832,-0.010257825,-0.016469484,-0.06447779,0.027638324,0.041974187,0.045531463,0.0015302076,-0.018747294,-0.016134875,0.076871194,0.053724255,-0.0206379,-0.085727945,0.052974515,0.08307386,0.09221229,-0.11351108,-0.10739518,0.080799885,0.07143476,-0.0790398,0.07529104,-0.04796278,0.024279801,0.0021256786,0.0962995,-0.025834057,-0.017576275,-0.031214288,-0.053369243,0.008494876,-0.0061792964,-0.018356698,0.023579732,-0.05119505,-0.073822066,-0.0009907938,-0.06322256,-0.056608524,-0.02929072,-0.0076124556,-0.00348777,0.028273737,0.071591236,0.010364583,0.035811182,-0.008131776,0.032505006,-0.03453676,-0.059172437,0.021086281,0.014640548,-0.03312722,-0.032380037,0.034719232,0.010955085,0.07183169,-0.10480041,-0.008728879,0.0013205584,-0.020401075,-0.010327734,0.047875192,-0.033699583,0.055460945,0.016779978,0.060505427,-0.025289448,0.035471037,-0.056638658,-0.039052498,0.025362045,-0.017712455,-0.01278573,-0.0061008735,-0.033554528,-0.06527981,-0.055920966,0.084955916,-0.021537952,-0.13202152,0.02378189,-0.0485917,-0.022154527,0.02815226,0.03516013,-0.13344972,0.0011108394,-0.010883572,-0.0266979,-0.029111391,0.071308754,-0.05211618,-0.014610909,0.021068629,-0.045364182,-0.06409481,0.020374654,0.02031075,0.014986787,-0.09678086,-0.052802075,0.005528007,-0.05953829,0.014281233,-0.05847514,0.00899362,-0.032751877,-0.03373069,0.028898902,-3.7862526e-33,-0.025665263,-0.058199186,0.052936595,0.029773496,0.048765793,-0.084388055,0.02836965,-0.037292235,-0.10770891,0.0072460542,-0.039256345,-0.06870387,-0.025365556,0.09215922,-0.00030330033,0.0042507495,0.023747649,-0.059616406,0.014611812,0.030495917,0.014157652,0.035874154,-6.024833e-05,-0.03855884,0.07639706,-0.039436426,0.037163366,-0.02567917,0.07462142,-0.015567857,0.008969328,-0.027078139,-0.027339257,0.011485177,0.0004022549,0.058376126,0.02178386,-0.0058565084,0.033289097,0.038623895,0.07121619,-0.030128792,-0.040087167,0.07355125,-0.003939981,0.021372076,-0.01303265,-0.024707919,0.109993346,-0.01876523,0.12428403,0.018034792,0.09814269,0.054143388,-0.008158145,0.053582355,0.054224033,0.016929058,0.023983179,0.004904065,-0.016069334,0.026853882,-0.10095295,-0.023494046,-0.045686804,0.075679824,-0.05056912,0.028385395,0.051179327,-0.027108775,-0.07157371,-0.0384864,0.009178316,0.02265132,-0.011689421,0.0009531081,-0.007635238,-0.00087812234,0.06217413,0.09019331,0.044459112,0.030896474,0.008797012,0.066889055,-0.02456299,0.051018853,-0.07358626,-0.021388404,0.084888555,0.08097689,0.0123476805,0.014261787,0.047143176,-0.02772457,-0.052085172,1.0428316e-33,0.006325307,-0.024537379,-0.085620515,0.14242977,0.057119977,-0.05077091,-0.10858189,0.04264912,0.015609781,-0.082405284,-0.043367628,0.0022514618,-0.00048041783,-0.03602001,0.070346236,0.06755003,0.03476345,0.12773955,0.011066185,-0.043411214,-0.0106962295,0.039097093,0.06507978,-0.031733718,-0.03599569,0.033934686,0.041926656,0.047759995,-0.036645792,0.03614949,0.018150045,-0.0061919414,0.06682984,-0.087855384,-0.01621103,0.04768425,-0.08121292,-0.11006866,-0.015777363,0.11275019,-0.023293898,-0.00948818,0.04890267,0.025458936,0.034232683,0.00462304,0.053341348,-0.0016953385,-0.006461555,0.011815378,0.04784848,0.011600896,0.011413242,0.04241829,0.04649162,-0.06846828,-0.02157922,0.044473257,-0.007914544,-0.04666736,0.009449899,0.033829182,-0.03424688,0.03841303,0.011272633,0.04806751,-0.057301626,-0.066439845,-0.11159806,0.026332848,0.0019438695,-0.08736774,0.034451235,-0.025814801,0.08191443,0.0010169124,-0.046126023,0.018146873,-0.07754074,0.04244425,0.0026177692,0.09878299,-0.022891106,-0.05271178,0.03756505,-0.0077661728,-0.0828579,-0.03339783,-0.013428056,0.037652683,-0.041630294,-0.07979111,-0.14711373,-0.039781302,0.17341499,-4.025077e-08,0.021211477,-0.010594613,-0.050492764,0.04504255,-0.037435636,-0.018912628,0.046232063,-0.015188334,0.052179787,0.034716833,-0.08280623,0.0025882218,-0.04975911,-0.020262074,-0.03512873,0.031489942,0.09488675,-0.013146869,-0.036800932,0.05130572,0.0068401494,0.022305952,0.023991577,-0.016188202,0.0030548342,-0.03162042,0.013191633,-0.044512264,-0.0029628412,-0.009551876,0.064668335,0.05081346,-0.04854552,0.07402485,-0.0059808595,0.020104954,-0.035105366,0.008434472,-0.020100048,-0.02950301,-0.043439835,0.0020850075,0.006743515,-0.046366002,-0.14708199,0.03101009,-0.039282393,0.047897935,-0.003637771,0.03511529,-0.030264877,-0.03206714,0.022436159,-0.01778261,0.044361025,0.038189013,0.07615961,-0.024286488,-0.01868749,-0.02104509,-0.05464636,0.05832998,0.12891576,-0.0063513257
"It can be put in brothy type soups or ramens. It will just cook like spinach in an instant once it's exposed to heat. Green beans, I prep them just by taking off the stem end and that's it.

"Asparagus, it grows up through the earth so it's really important to wash it well, it can be gritty. [ping]

"Scallion, they're a member of the onion family but they have a milder flavor than a raw onion. So they're delicious on absolutely everything. 
Take off the root end and then just cut it really thinly on an angle. And you can go all the way. I actually like the green part. It looks really pretty, like that. 
And this you can keep in the fridge in a jar and sprinkle over your salads, your grains, your soups, it makes everything taste better.",-0.06253536,-0.01796648,0.038098898,0.020514315,-0.014334014,0.040264565,-0.03848071,-0.05779743,0.05180414,-0.026866881,0.042245213,-0.075660065,-0.018363351,-0.066049114,0.00806399,-0.05123579,0.12005756,-0.038250703,-0.032267954,-0.07475766,0.047479894,0.063074276,-0.0006397098,0.015771683,0.018759875,0.035644878,-0.02308149,0.07602596,-0.021325806,-0.07144066,0.03302922,-0.03554071,-0.046744283,-0.011332008,-0.041683324,-0.0026654007,-0.017892355,-0.06932433,0.046530563,-0.027634973,0.017722923,0.04232821,0.045670103,-0.020924691,-0.060602024,-0.038646415,-0.06403025,0.042205125,0.0027748423,-0.02958981,-0.035729654,-0.07005121,-0.11470532,0.020457657,0.056797326,0.041899122,-0.084511034,-0.045648426,0.017038545,-0.055022772,0.07040681,-0.05665865,0.01231599,0.0442687,-0.063299954,0.042300574,0.021577679,-0.005664628,-0.012415917,-0.035921738,-0.016300416,0.058050033,0.016343916,0.07319567,-0.0314753,-0.029674092,0.036244057,-0.079947434,-0.08102995,0.036325768,-0.057762515,0.040269814,-0.044210088,0.037688106,0.013180049,0.049980305,-0.0620326,0.033929422,-0.02548472,0.01703438,0.016714279,0.0052759764,0.022798253,-0.0755525,0.04992938,0.09914395,-0.039085466,-0.078294545,-0.028669981,-0.01604579,0.015136454,-0.0181475,0.010881703,-0.11241305,-0.02225326,-0.027136756,-0.0319114,0.019500205,-0.04721011,-0.003056768,0.03360332,0.00049198116,-0.036681782,-0.12085004,-0.02666325,-0.05641133,0.080882974,0.018685874,-0.0016467404,0.006164371,-0.04275116,0.0088232355,-0.051027913,0.0030645253,-0.0005212148,0.02279518,-0.019869287,-2.3620051e-33,-0.013480159,0.028562764,0.057109814,-0.013378075,0.04022474,-0.04594008,-0.018661654,0.0003301271,-0.07752336,0.04998624,-0.0732914,-0.029930532,-0.053970654,0.00021025726,0.12523094,-0.059484787,-0.061032303,-0.008271143,-0.027822878,-0.012208729,-0.05609195,0.038385954,0.046938404,0.055521,-0.048446435,-0.1267773,0.04585626,0.0074344175,-0.07452208,-0.028229082,0.05974676,0.03506766,-0.045728628,-0.053904936,-0.056324128,-0.009146747,-0.10630449,-0.03565399,0.039665908,0.068885565,0.0655368,0.03983402,0.011387197,0.16223778,0.014745783,0.03757407,-0.033772368,0.08943278,0.07843843,-0.005226009,0.099445246,-0.0030452902,0.07811071,-0.03481996,-0.07950847,0.06830892,0.07232277,0.002899482,-0.048988722,0.00038663167,-0.010285664,0.03449186,-0.0006626299,-0.040641654,-0.022686116,0.019034168,-0.064651564,0.025691228,-0.04775056,-0.064770564,-0.043979462,-0.0030092616,0.047932323,0.02577829,0.036324505,-0.004357679,-0.0018695928,-0.0071431105,0.049582876,0.02024624,0.098477975,0.019520896,-0.06582521,-0.013780717,-0.060635008,0.00028292334,-0.12661998,-0.008894393,0.18576919,0.025873562,0.02381748,-0.0707267,0.027977154,-0.00943192,-0.0977111,9.45426e-34,-0.07384604,-0.050914906,-0.0010565798,0.102104485,0.07598685,-0.03666152,-0.11939161,0.009268064,-0.004029407,0.0083963955,0.02358437,0.05152451,0.006251212,-0.04763578,0.011310381,0.08751257,0.047247946,0.038043972,0.0782091,-0.029316077,-0.016953155,0.01155563,0.015335389,-0.01338395,0.016971387,0.09993405,0.046621542,0.05862772,0.065379076,-0.0069273976,0.06388418,-0.08009216,0.052496325,-0.058837034,-0.040425617,0.09082058,-0.03770131,-0.044448968,0.06780047,0.06429378,0.008650853,0.028055573,0.07836982,0.054725636,0.020025283,0.01668169,-0.0052251955,-0.02154313,-0.14953773,0.004232244,-0.02253398,0.09064623,-4.541831e-05,0.014590741,0.03530518,-0.033853326,-0.05707789,-0.013545728,0.02797472,-0.01509595,-0.026987381,0.049272127,-0.0011363048,0.06921922,0.0135087,-0.01651229,-0.0721769,-0.038476724,-0.13540831,-0.014634888,-0.09755711,-0.0524347,-0.014813847,-0.09651752,0.08574066,-0.059147824,-0.036210388,0.0030226468,-0.03313469,0.09514335,-0.002791228,0.025742223,-0.021639891,0.01610478,0.043258876,0.04958177,-0.0056458176,0.06763882,0.042836208,0.017178424,-0.04232477,0.021818357,-0.0017819548,0.083358265,0.09700218,-4.547959e-08,0.08918236,0.046253067,0.017499276,0.009559076,-0.0060029337,-0.05031485,-0.0073440582,0.012609349,0.03290186,-0.032997567,-0.065079235,0.0019743727,-0.076683484,-0.027662639,0.02479843,0.07511888,-0.07212037,-0.0049462384,0.034102123,0.014017371,-0.0061690486,0.011379525,0.05661578,-0.033739567,0.0056814905,0.01819859,0.007901284,0.0072777304,0.017952187,0.11617706,0.0054145795,-0.0035099431,-0.011180408,0.025985286,-0.05281279,0.03286752,-0.045466002,-0.009413775,0.009830853,0.009002882,-0.021425275,-0.0874359,-0.024057785,0.023222247,-0.074819505,-0.01674482,0.020264482,0.063304335,0.013694563,0.08148306,-0.056910332,-0.027182223,-0.0128756445,0.0442962,0.0065224734,-0.048160344,0.0726145,-0.05091142,0.012387757,0.06554796,0.024536123,0.022350743,0.031133838,0.085372694
"Celery, this is how I'd prep a celery. I'd break off each stem that I need like this. [celery cracking open] The inner ones are much more tender and the leaves can be used as well.

"Onion, there are different types. This is the cipollini onion. This is a yellow onion and this is a white onion. 
I like to cut an onion by taking off the root first and running the knife down the length longways of the onion and then peeling off the outer layer. 
And then I cut it lengthways and acrossways after that and then I like to cut it like this because it just falls apart nicely and I like it for just about anything.",-0.04319346,0.005471163,0.036405183,0.023805598,-0.027582081,-0.0075983163,-0.045838043,-0.044538304,0.06550954,0.04309702,0.08075594,-0.00046638228,-0.069240585,0.03467124,-0.039353225,-0.037202857,-0.004267492,0.020932604,-0.04319969,-0.016538244,0.105137885,0.030286534,0.004316433,-0.029626273,0.020544637,-0.054355495,-0.01454588,0.04043648,0.01957733,-0.048881534,0.0783684,-0.009070177,-0.023266505,0.08340367,-0.06129052,-0.022475936,-0.09741192,0.022248652,0.05196053,0.002278924,0.047396056,-0.00913676,0.018382693,0.008013891,0.002298446,-0.03487028,-0.09133082,-0.004804444,-0.0057612336,-0.06297914,-0.021404339,-0.018697519,-0.1486782,0.048751935,0.023527395,-0.029980171,-0.06699921,0.07441009,0.01295811,0.037079956,0.07963774,-0.017497107,-0.032675806,-0.0092587825,-0.035741717,0.06842029,0.005189544,-0.06595026,-0.022195185,-0.05079295,0.052683085,0.021373471,-0.0284217,0.097964816,0.024056992,-0.07493991,-0.00015028878,-0.0049349302,-0.16894029,0.0001982758,-0.026329234,0.038531885,-0.029546196,0.049814392,-0.0037597513,0.087431826,-0.03193272,0.05951892,-0.024406046,0.0019012861,0.010054932,0.07077228,0.017610202,-0.037985347,0.053635657,0.0315337,-0.06443052,-0.013213054,-0.05551625,0.0077562095,0.028516559,-0.050320685,-0.07455428,-0.05339955,0.011312568,-0.049927484,-0.006888576,-0.012450558,-0.058081217,-0.07580298,0.0287993,0.056964587,-0.08284456,-0.09960825,0.046489164,-0.08688499,0.068760276,0.03370165,0.09706582,0.11849013,0.014636519,-0.03676609,-0.107106656,0.026734319,-0.030242246,0.0938018,0.046429437,-2.7402599e-33,-0.027128818,0.07400607,-0.037975173,-0.01000319,0.0032061334,0.015037129,0.009777084,0.0011608034,-0.055877138,0.020012202,-0.020773496,-0.06750973,-0.07618256,0.086480536,0.06683683,-0.003448146,0.0026947362,0.026332192,-0.050606906,-0.032857276,0.03936386,0.04981748,0.025467671,0.062027074,-0.02432369,-0.08308261,-0.01183585,-0.06602315,-0.015546579,-0.031604856,0.040191755,-0.02626344,0.032995526,-0.051397208,-0.048202425,0.058008824,-0.022419175,-0.028738901,0.015074097,0.010151469,-0.019565996,0.044931494,-0.028406123,0.12572417,0.04617485,0.040987514,-0.058247887,0.096657656,-0.006301156,-0.02324911,0.09164383,0.030037194,0.10911077,-0.04476619,0.0035841751,0.04643798,0.10503991,0.019031543,-0.005109594,0.012086917,0.022280095,0.015267245,-0.044656374,0.026669294,-0.04195761,0.039134063,-0.09986167,-0.0020579505,-0.02013619,-0.075280495,-0.11195415,-0.0133230295,-0.014701443,0.039440077,-0.013796886,-0.015365307,-0.02993859,-0.033316813,0.045054223,-0.02614993,-0.0008491195,0.084041424,0.012607735,-0.03493873,-0.04307614,0.038741086,-0.107371524,-0.0007314821,0.1566825,-0.008022691,0.0031809327,-0.007246558,0.02224126,0.023701608,0.019789534,1.2220623e-33,-0.09951339,-0.005218127,-0.08095789,0.021268127,0.046027828,0.00622911,-0.11980156,-0.030672193,-0.02902626,0.018971054,0.026380109,-0.06750692,-0.0077919285,-0.036542684,0.00037599864,-0.05650591,-0.005008092,0.05969667,0.05049861,0.06052014,-0.14746104,-0.0007058481,0.065538794,-0.028747646,-0.010539124,0.068588465,0.056694783,0.06316209,0.057271495,-0.03377923,-0.004348859,-0.065554105,0.05696964,-0.03459646,-0.007737654,0.11053793,-0.09231629,-0.055135194,0.07653203,-0.0034888636,-0.018767763,-0.03750853,0.06865834,-0.007981602,0.000926602,-0.02078954,0.08081162,-0.012380325,-0.10352276,0.023565495,-0.0174968,0.08259567,-0.04212503,0.030493945,0.024465762,0.008595373,-0.08199839,-0.034298554,0.033114824,-0.038908504,-0.039172996,-0.0037919686,0.043088254,0.10067443,0.026640277,-0.06480465,-0.013951652,0.007911057,-0.07407577,-0.039444096,-0.08699783,-0.020692015,-0.051802937,-0.10685399,0.016389567,-0.10068266,-0.0438028,0.008221178,-0.064527236,0.051649213,-0.010937077,0.038932838,-0.029078899,-0.021936083,0.001384957,0.03540979,0.017341163,0.095739014,0.014185305,-0.0027254468,-0.017594896,0.053193763,0.042539805,0.02501611,0.04025909,-4.038861e-08,0.12862213,0.10924796,0.02141683,0.023254646,0.05065415,-0.077491716,0.0041802684,-0.009238312,-0.0033723614,0.042122677,-0.048124567,0.016574793,-0.054258343,-0.011500192,0.025152316,-0.02924899,0.008234557,0.005806101,0.060770318,0.03219427,-0.032675266,-0.0330574,0.013790684,-0.04279163,-0.008811179,-0.0066344487,-0.043941934,0.020986956,0.018185655,0.10903511,-0.0066969045,0.07198883,1.610138e-05,0.025820306,-0.010873352,0.0641828,0.031503573,0.054524317,0.005772657,-0.011944147,-0.008415328,-0.078196764,-0.0191542,0.031745892,-0.042477313,-0.009700658,0.096073724,-0.047430273,-4.9205704e-05,0.10832439,-0.008165548,-0.057331916,-0.014533582,-0.027857345,0.008639973,-0.007650055,0.037924103,-0.02271039,0.018665994,-0.036340058,-0.002710181,-0.012044516,0.04114594,0.08921998
"If you were to roast it you could leave it in bigger chunks like this or even whole actually with the skin on. You can just put it in the oven for a really long time.
This is like a classic way to just dice but you just saw your way towards the root, don't go all the way. And then do a few more slices the other way, not going all the way through, whoops.

"Radicchio, radicchio is delicious both cooked and raw. But more commonly you'll find it raw in salads where you can just peal off the leaves and break them up by hand, no need to cut them.
It doesn't look that great cut, I don't think. I think it's actually better to break up the pieces like this. The only reason I would cut it is if I was cooking it.",0.0012989005,-0.014618451,-0.00907839,0.035842814,0.06944859,-0.024887178,-0.055597037,0.02933309,-0.04371104,0.055280916,0.02478541,0.006793176,-0.034581162,-0.05898062,0.017738555,-0.054137487,0.10865609,0.047465507,-0.06979356,-0.028473167,0.032784104,0.06602907,-0.0003308853,0.017231211,0.090351015,-0.053793103,0.043729696,-0.0062068533,-0.032072894,-0.038200427,0.057481185,-0.061892215,0.050982248,-0.021242414,-0.0052127517,0.027082706,-0.05248038,-0.014944654,0.05165684,-0.07035711,0.03266753,0.020008594,0.022978855,0.015360689,-0.03201352,-0.05428738,-0.052800383,-0.03313981,0.04124282,-0.016640222,-0.105796225,0.062218785,-0.057198476,0.023936866,-0.066193506,0.070267186,-0.015777295,-0.05179002,-0.028048282,0.06950862,0.0026450523,-0.017540243,0.0027505183,-0.06902335,0.0065558134,-0.029926142,-0.037977543,-0.037857104,0.057276163,0.021179214,-0.010388213,0.059628427,0.03965722,-0.07403821,-0.08632811,-0.064375095,-0.031325713,-0.032595452,-0.055583034,0.09889357,-0.014265447,0.012530805,0.028614394,-0.029464133,-0.00033440028,0.04170999,-0.027190628,0.031717002,-0.062117722,0.027430141,-0.0017843847,0.05202303,0.09795187,-0.030394474,-0.035807204,0.057924666,-0.008364578,-0.06244248,0.007416207,-0.007826288,0.0044663534,-0.064874396,0.009336412,-0.070603706,-0.07637514,-0.067364015,-0.04227722,-0.06487889,-0.019409155,-0.030194374,0.037408046,0.06939242,-0.042765494,-0.09051706,-0.030776756,0.015423333,0.090684995,-0.04758549,0.028428854,0.092282586,0.030435365,-0.0069116903,-0.031911045,0.0546415,0.039748296,-0.043518655,0.07338319,2.4007962e-33,-0.025821198,0.068305366,-0.017979449,-0.076775886,0.054149687,0.061959345,-0.06824869,0.0021343236,-0.040806636,0.0185276,0.04138018,-0.10559925,0.03698173,0.021773262,-0.03004268,0.0020602625,0.019707987,0.01335704,-0.038005438,-0.0058080843,-0.0084546115,0.03087056,-0.00033128768,0.029559067,-0.08394686,-0.036057815,-0.017103292,-0.0868609,-0.022871664,0.0377642,0.01353829,0.0172025,-0.03701464,0.085983,-0.0672477,0.04315854,-0.10737077,-0.053171214,0.0074212835,0.01784884,-0.011712415,0.04717434,-0.030399457,0.09357045,-0.009578084,-0.0050279,0.012543595,0.058278594,0.0057780202,0.043198146,0.054474287,0.05219184,0.13844797,-0.020151488,0.007957607,-0.024068587,0.12973572,0.0628363,0.017773889,-0.02594324,0.03604074,0.008528948,-0.0800109,0.030620826,-0.06311779,0.076915614,-0.03724811,0.021488568,0.06807553,-0.0647429,-0.08622095,0.022996247,-0.03366755,0.06384715,-0.049528684,-0.015471743,0.04338808,0.10622732,0.0152796665,-0.002426231,0.033047933,0.12126501,0.012994009,-0.031459935,0.00080212724,0.024621766,-0.1317014,-0.018964661,0.12801073,0.030919027,0.005522961,-0.050428443,-0.020990925,0.07578925,-0.011245338,-1.0742389e-33,-0.0676595,0.024752436,-0.042194944,0.08394411,0.014576723,-0.05418728,-0.11131303,0.055610593,0.012364364,-0.08957781,0.0023336143,-0.022410037,-0.033921383,-0.038345627,0.04300187,0.017610338,0.11481043,0.070968084,0.03545788,-0.05406349,-0.11773516,0.01794403,0.034360867,-0.019045211,-0.028379383,0.0003235553,0.07476574,-0.047203444,0.00944954,0.0015296005,-0.039510246,-0.033981107,0.013020261,-0.050923802,-0.019439459,0.034526877,-0.17831314,-0.008433172,0.059256453,0.08323525,0.019706422,0.002252995,-0.012720487,0.030129774,-0.032505512,-0.08810533,0.03502193,0.029337067,-0.02149725,-0.03845749,0.01520234,0.01361262,0.0021518078,-0.062304154,0.07746451,-0.035511192,-0.016419865,0.019637594,0.0054183495,-0.080440395,-0.0172825,0.08882218,0.018028622,0.06763185,0.07328078,0.02365112,0.005618598,0.0047578164,-0.08945114,0.03510128,-0.0052015767,0.06682754,0.042056,0.049806733,0.09421935,0.0042605377,-0.040273298,0.024861475,-0.058579113,0.094076045,0.0110666705,-0.0078816395,-0.008304055,-0.09010443,0.021846201,0.018097447,-0.08760565,0.02617795,-0.03783372,-0.10740549,-0.05475287,0.025786096,0.008653781,0.094288655,0.118572794,-3.9143828e-08,0.12571524,0.0040621585,-0.082109466,0.019805133,0.014036756,0.030068176,-0.004474652,-0.022904927,-0.018881876,0.0784173,-0.02319687,0.04048403,-0.048834875,0.020713573,-0.10560286,0.01814934,0.09227285,0.0023732241,0.01829851,0.08504154,-0.023331955,-0.011066439,0.09243367,-0.03995118,-0.022503195,0.0015346272,0.016300263,-0.01658676,0.034525346,-0.013215598,0.0036899378,-0.0012793608,0.01291731,0.08413143,-0.02961582,0.020321166,-0.07209938,0.006554976,-0.015352302,0.025885554,0.052251946,-0.0053342935,0.04429517,0.026453335,-0.08284853,-0.0095899915,0.043032978,-0.008929217,-0.0032663175,0.021269726,-0.045028444,-0.039977875,0.03246503,0.0019066568,0.05330375,-0.08049561,0.09042512,0.022235483,-0.03622963,-0.013485255,-0.017163383,-0.018929807,0.030886771,0.025149519

It's a very similar kind of flavor, mildly sort of pungent but not very strong, especially when you cook it, that's chicory.",0.014325581,0.0040977835,0.07375623,0.026237672,-0.0060850848,-0.06387962,-0.03433531,0.03440618,-0.017334115,-0.039353047,-0.077932104,-0.055825386,-0.099028826,-0.09872207,-0.00205809,-0.10471496,0.02165976,-0.0635906,-0.040787533,-0.0015315856,-0.023939693,-0.05574004,0.0012629982,0.058808282,0.007163712,0.018010011,0.031551044,0.031635728,0.04671628,-0.14161707,0.08243927,0.017771712,0.0312632,-0.019404363,-0.10134707,0.0006953343,0.068819374,0.017087258,-0.02321938,-0.025428372,0.08095666,0.06560546,0.03973649,-0.057705104,0.05028282,-0.028161265,-0.015135169,-0.048520163,0.091366224,-0.02285657,-0.015675075,-0.065806895,-0.033609428,0.04353625,-0.07083313,0.050323077,0.059635103,0.01560336,0.052758776,0.10952835,0.015589042,0.04127498,0.013771355,0.0010786445,-0.03383089,-0.06435713,0.02160368,-0.030575577,0.035081957,0.09269123,-0.004014166,-0.010583492,-0.009089101,-0.024086405,-0.025178188,0.008352869,0.015235619,-0.10083191,0.02192219,0.1651749,-0.0880582,0.10107413,0.048155315,-0.0038020362,-0.04973119,0.08149135,-0.035578586,0.023474105,0.027748898,-0.008906584,-0.007991662,0.030116446,0.024797264,0.015986681,0.052205764,0.08707116,0.020209752,-0.10210735,0.013625222,0.0089412145,-0.018475868,0.020500211,0.078647405,-0.06773123,-0.046774697,-0.03729571,-0.074505955,0.044909526,0.04718973,-0.058297403,0.015401014,0.09805652,-0.009612898,-0.014869918,-0.03123177,-0.022660745,0.035700772,-0.016272249,-0.043374978,0.024247138,0.019302456,-0.067375936,-0.03666234,0.0029455503,-0.06608323,-0.049957287,0.04016957,-2.0448459e-33,-0.0069374465,0.061300986,-0.004239488,7.9381345e-05,0.106787235,-0.019651739,0.011821605,0.041904587,-0.07941726,0.08120553,0.07552821,-0.06191375,-0.06602268,0.020973807,0.014054015,-0.07089855,-0.061813608,-0.015596409,-0.049866304,-0.01149315,0.026942575,-0.037730098,-0.09676507,0.05334217,-0.044896632,0.037078395,-0.079635255,-0.042603962,0.02309397,0.016859874,-0.022612885,0.041569732,-0.067505494,0.02921942,-0.039579395,-0.038774822,-0.020226058,0.010005127,-0.014184296,0.04425618,-0.010021404,0.05752879,0.00398563,0.050940797,-0.04033079,-0.030195475,0.06224802,0.07505452,0.06423286,-0.0043210234,0.07357496,0.006062786,0.119754516,0.015480847,-0.062084638,0.060101565,0.060441703,-0.04482893,0.036036387,-0.034575634,0.046214096,0.012203668,-0.013710217,0.08264491,-0.07520841,0.021858273,-0.1274409,0.0119805485,0.02403859,-0.057772756,-0.05935989,0.01910864,-0.036776323,-0.049563307,-0.07342408,-0.05202864,0.029704163,0.039771352,0.058795735,-0.011193652,0.062349178,0.026166456,-0.014231929,0.035278462,-0.0021821298,-0.0058143544,-0.07497849,0.025792385,0.021533944,0.013808058,-0.08519967,-0.052673902,0.037829444,-0.061800998,-0.010210814,-1.1218763e-34,0.033762086,-0.037691835,0.009383164,0.010517511,-0.02210385,0.04607563,-0.020953918,0.08382886,-0.02503486,-0.09810665,-0.019366864,0.0035875845,0.03214808,-0.015047027,-0.039366238,0.08113571,0.019522715,0.08388383,-0.018623404,-0.067639746,-0.086535506,-0.025584139,-0.035309996,-0.031179234,0.04620855,-0.0063735214,0.049925115,-0.05783984,-0.016960315,-0.027618475,-0.010027282,-0.11033452,0.03348329,-0.08634697,-0.012684877,0.08270835,-0.02250729,-0.058016147,0.050953824,0.01004387,-0.016672466,0.028683389,-0.01679139,0.104834236,-0.00074635114,-0.012080598,-0.011505552,-0.031062543,-0.009155843,0.11364768,0.0060914457,-0.016958995,-0.019770976,0.018977243,0.028108636,-0.021497129,-0.0051064524,-0.07029739,-0.08336675,-0.10564555,-0.09329123,0.054437943,-0.049078338,0.07834671,0.052593365,-0.03455275,-0.03938053,-0.04715604,-0.039445695,-0.020242516,-0.00014969427,0.047951184,0.033347826,-0.0077742185,0.028360179,-0.0066629043,0.017937208,-0.03994166,0.012476271,0.007571775,0.07745429,-0.033947553,0.05142839,-0.11250563,-0.02976253,-0.004447815,-0.041760202,0.05406919,-0.014621562,0.010645612,-0.038692266,-0.03181534,-0.01573493,0.08361577,0.14845635,-4.516347e-08,0.043763563,-0.058307808,-0.03683487,-0.007451781,0.021940235,0.05711347,-0.044711348,-0.036894526,-0.0025097854,-0.01150295,-0.057930123,0.059466157,-0.061461795,0.063678645,-0.051271424,0.013966477,0.07830337,0.081787854,-0.036762133,0.0113730375,-0.076175064,0.025416875,0.119269095,-0.07262974,0.03902306,-0.0032156745,-0.0185987,-0.028067216,0.0013714154,0.017180737,-0.06599281,0.024490558,-0.082454056,0.06542532,-0.020717256,0.020934481,-0.046938732,-0.0035734717,-0.06482565,0.0007237792,0.07785314,0.008148734,-0.06519615,0.016579911,-0.040338717,0.048457026,0.025652448,0.035037402,-0.0075279744,0.13421488,0.006797142,0.01414493,0.0035714344,0.079771034,-0.0433779,0.0033178842,0.0011510246,0.044251345,-0.01063662,-0.059933133,-0.028230013,0.067742035,0.07521703,0.007749444
"Mustard greens, mustard greens are very mustarady. They are extremely strong when eaten raw and a little bit goes a long way, especially with these bigger leaves. 
You wanna look for very tender, younger leaves if you're gonna eat it raw. Tear it off the stem 'cause the stem's pretty strong and then just tear them into bite-size pieces.
It's really good with some shaved pear or apple or even other root vegetables shaved really thin.

"You can treat it the same way as you would kale or collard greens and I don't really bother taking out the stems if I'm cooking it. Just take off the bottom and then slice it straight across the leaf. 
If you've got an unwieldy bunch just stack it. It's not very fussy because you're just gonna saute and you're gonna keep cooking until it's wilted down. It does turn a bit brown but it really will mellow out the flavor.",-0.025747713,0.048152782,-0.04612453,0.01126794,0.018248549,-0.026623566,0.0013588243,0.025422905,-0.032064855,0.034250263,-0.023490967,-0.018674294,-0.060883738,-0.03479746,-0.00795578,0.014502031,-0.016361827,0.027170148,-0.057804264,-0.046860375,-0.03850595,-0.032327026,-0.0008109387,-0.009352791,0.008036376,-0.03177547,0.020926675,0.009074143,0.03879143,-0.075102545,0.04662979,0.12006369,-0.07219418,0.003979396,-0.11108128,-0.027273033,-0.034558605,-0.0061838464,0.028562538,-0.065586485,0.13331613,0.04955546,0.004608399,-0.03453385,-0.025743486,-0.0171478,-0.05434083,-0.03124901,-0.022047454,-0.093481645,0.076931246,-0.12179524,0.0017901808,-0.0111039085,-0.052977204,-0.0019631553,0.02825991,0.0028803607,0.084272,0.06527426,0.051909517,-0.09319883,0.0335999,-0.048560437,-0.08799586,-0.021325639,0.0046616243,0.02436994,0.058338664,0.01820305,0.033459596,-0.012634373,-0.026322812,-0.037053633,-0.0066033513,0.02874764,0.010500315,-0.04356276,-0.015536919,0.084860384,-0.043013453,0.05582045,0.049131088,-0.001418285,0.00059249107,0.034372862,-0.07485731,0.057406932,0.0032800387,0.07682185,0.05056395,0.00468861,0.031436365,-0.029068993,-0.0278478,0.025964543,0.06056212,-0.1266607,-0.011227033,0.035493363,-0.03017985,-0.00946091,-0.002313203,-0.06751731,-0.10960292,-0.060836464,-0.04996225,-0.059021514,-0.016212175,-0.06574361,-0.0693569,0.06418735,-0.018600829,-0.035364423,-0.007604515,0.03835843,0.15418938,-0.021175046,-0.03404604,-0.04685601,0.021746762,0.0007575263,0.0058700806,0.012829704,-0.03434692,0.009224739,0.011247183,-1.7493968e-33,0.024822338,0.031972755,-0.071938805,-0.06638575,0.105057694,-0.080587715,-0.029692702,-0.055716813,-0.047956318,-0.028384529,0.05655027,-0.065850005,-0.03838381,-0.05063434,-0.01993064,-0.04701601,-0.024036357,0.011644651,-0.029601114,-0.012294292,0.031708952,-0.054603174,-0.08758555,0.06499118,0.0068868115,-0.047433846,-0.001519129,0.0030568095,0.029996704,-0.012313375,0.042772304,0.027254548,-0.06569606,0.003947293,0.025012322,-0.0279719,-0.048582867,0.05340891,-0.00046788552,0.012760066,0.023539215,0.025165802,0.03895069,0.06520529,-0.02021419,0.025763696,0.025270088,-0.021215005,0.008420173,-0.012503732,0.05865452,0.0678899,0.10691927,0.0039184466,-0.0044791023,0.08608205,0.13152143,-0.038564753,0.024980651,-0.054041486,0.05066239,-0.0071106604,-0.012287387,0.020926397,-0.00037848522,-0.00046977284,-0.19013013,-0.0064820247,-0.09897105,-0.029096866,-0.02173034,0.060296588,-0.043802977,-0.07835172,-0.044022635,-0.016571358,0.065528065,0.11838845,0.035531465,-0.0029804711,0.040667504,0.0451968,-0.026470095,0.0082952725,-0.006896563,-0.049165487,-0.095187545,0.022787083,0.08201524,-0.013359538,-0.006436836,-0.038410265,-0.0023719687,-0.05719433,0.012726365,3.263931e-34,0.06989629,0.030118918,0.044950552,0.10544886,-0.014205471,0.015924778,-0.014142432,0.031262852,0.081165984,-0.01960424,-0.063115604,0.04973226,-0.015372163,0.058285467,0.02410421,0.058896154,-0.026936067,0.15358028,-0.053565685,-0.05818501,-0.12888587,-0.0046600415,0.007844141,-0.046184916,-0.025280518,0.018454084,0.03404601,-0.015696015,0.020943236,-0.070464455,0.02679543,-0.07570591,-0.016812373,-0.16108693,-0.036509752,0.0067755138,-0.008229286,-5.1966257e-05,0.06562764,0.0642538,0.015077125,0.009539214,-0.05253025,0.07109008,-0.016934212,-0.031254563,-0.019744907,0.03441217,-0.05554098,0.01352859,-0.027219307,0.120227866,-0.0051221796,0.08291793,0.03650029,-0.056032773,0.070620485,0.0046499586,-0.06269605,-0.04819411,-0.04815298,-0.023010403,0.009236664,0.0026827455,0.016232425,-0.029572353,-0.049037933,0.025170738,0.0071447105,0.0038596888,-0.046151396,0.02572925,-0.011387219,-0.04690025,0.08006406,-0.043464143,0.05272556,-0.0010734091,0.043931063,-0.0039558792,0.021978967,-0.006740587,0.020928586,-0.083456784,-0.012546393,-0.05920284,-0.0012952401,0.035754867,0.028978668,-0.09238509,-0.02909014,-0.03146264,0.048702683,0.088527344,0.08014066,-5.4905186e-08,0.0009469268,-0.060456753,-0.025188088,0.060599886,0.049215812,-0.029911892,-0.07436185,0.0154521745,0.05117518,-0.038355384,-0.12856388,0.0673857,-0.03423866,-0.0051362957,0.042382482,0.041445304,-0.005777439,0.04416878,-0.01344084,0.078158446,-0.084182225,0.025009949,0.059549525,-0.031351462,0.043996893,0.0264646,0.0067499815,-0.007861499,0.04473163,0.046224784,0.054078925,0.08084262,-0.051962905,0.07363454,-0.0134354,-0.0010443716,0.02823073,0.033580955,-0.029473525,0.056586232,-0.008383778,0.014633384,-0.068799846,0.024992097,-0.14659457,0.04811744,-0.024169732,0.06949777,-0.015072159,0.054149155,0.027397389,-0.00928962,0.03512481,0.055645514,-0.045146175,0.050426714,0.123865694,-0.030781357,0.05327526,-0.012001965,-0.057468247,0.010704855,0.06758664,0.030913929
"Collard greens, collard greens are a dark leafy green vegetable. I like to steam them, saute them, sometimes marinade them and eat them raw, but only when they're super fresh.
The way to prepare them is to cut off their tough stems. Just take off a couple of inches.

"Or you could dice it a little bit like just squares. If you're steaming you can also just steam the whole leaf. If you're sauteing take the stems out and cut them up. You can cut them up nice and fine like this. 
If you cut it like this you saute it first and then add the leaves last when this is tender, starts to get a bit soft. But no reason to throw these out because they're so beautiful and colorful and delicious too.

"Fennel, fennel is a juicy, delicious vegetable with an anise kind of flavor. I love to shave it raw for a salad. Cut off the stems, save these for a stock or broth. 
Take off the tougher sort of root end. Cut it in half lengthways, face it down. Cut it in half again and then take out the core. You then shave it lengthways, on a mandolin is really easy.",0.016631564,0.036946513,-0.07226962,0.03187877,-0.027315155,-0.08049803,-0.003948742,0.029410634,-0.057510033,-0.004099295,0.0102091525,0.030692775,-0.063736595,0.065240175,-0.042742696,-0.05403126,0.045417715,0.08196038,-0.0051717744,-0.019488808,-0.013550885,0.045935765,0.054724358,0.0041833157,0.031076783,-0.05387202,0.004840604,0.023442483,-0.045911912,-0.05827581,0.114327565,0.0118756,-0.00039586858,-0.039134856,-0.019413652,-0.04509071,0.0051404554,0.00019481365,0.106284775,0.053068917,-0.0031804244,-0.010285755,-0.05437283,-0.040833775,-0.017376488,-0.011386333,-0.078497216,0.02463419,0.020935463,-0.03047543,-0.03429816,-0.06617421,-0.06666961,0.023255674,0.014280141,-0.048448093,-0.046634503,0.043844417,0.054372355,0.061442997,0.058240213,-0.04158223,-0.014562981,0.014026436,-0.050586056,-0.078129366,0.051386714,-0.010539745,-0.016113702,0.03234294,-0.027111338,-0.05543142,0.029886352,-0.016282106,-0.051726323,-0.030516703,-0.04249659,0.0036633138,-0.024561299,0.07691739,0.00812677,-0.0148494495,-0.0127694355,0.10987485,0.03303738,0.058207195,0.032018278,0.08475984,-0.051984295,0.025112938,0.02683667,0.101661205,-0.015262173,0.027306749,-0.03157725,-0.050172534,0.09454126,0.070232786,-0.061002735,0.046934057,-0.01112626,-0.115202345,-0.029132603,0.0044363015,-0.06780945,-0.10750242,-0.033289235,0.03443985,0.07628138,-0.061292097,-0.0034775208,-0.005426874,-0.114035875,-0.06247355,0.0029065933,0.014947414,0.072379395,-0.049140148,0.017026255,0.038530987,0.018707935,0.06657225,-0.0129389465,0.073181935,0.021127503,0.05813604,0.0134090185,5.3230903e-34,0.010750349,0.22794378,-0.032183003,-0.057857893,-0.026939645,-0.006367693,-0.093017675,0.02893261,0.01185296,0.0041184016,-0.014122183,0.033057507,-0.023170924,-0.04497378,0.009780227,-0.11858744,-0.022408087,0.03420642,0.052563615,-0.06567157,0.0007015486,0.005793099,-0.022737721,-0.009704399,0.029823652,-0.072721645,-0.020894697,-0.10945629,-0.01220865,0.0015019511,0.051912572,-0.036065616,-0.003574597,0.03223095,-0.05507209,0.035789445,0.025329342,-0.10022761,-0.039673164,-0.034079794,-0.027740568,0.0120995995,0.08316787,0.016325599,-0.034089148,-0.04043382,-0.06312502,0.09246889,0.010987069,0.020841323,0.066638224,0.001200033,0.13704628,-0.018508688,-0.09551398,0.044060312,-0.0013192688,-0.021325858,0.06848391,0.03325965,0.06057304,-0.043032076,-0.021758366,-0.006083175,-0.04046805,0.019083869,-0.07732633,0.07441868,0.061057128,-0.01702829,-0.08772331,0.07222995,0.112408705,-0.0020578525,-0.034471292,0.048477016,-0.003282229,0.058120362,-0.02490603,-0.037764207,0.018445782,0.019621778,-0.027777612,-0.007287799,0.0009334429,-0.0086798165,-0.022653777,0.009104238,0.052823726,-0.008491499,-0.040346436,-0.09319443,-0.028773684,-0.020785801,0.020204987,3.5945313e-34,0.080472276,-0.025329916,-0.043067187,0.097645044,0.033595495,0.014870466,0.0054732934,0.03255467,-0.033278793,-0.020214302,-0.015031405,-0.0033181037,0.1082207,-0.07216184,-0.028682478,-0.017551733,0.00068939343,0.0021604632,0.056318965,-0.058295865,-0.12910187,-0.0024242622,0.031478092,-0.008034782,-0.09577146,0.062138434,0.03655064,-0.075158045,0.05458002,0.050615326,0.060120914,-0.100513846,0.02500072,-0.0686404,-0.026984992,0.14108191,-0.002135114,0.036272287,0.040806033,-0.04109773,-0.0051910514,-0.022535693,-0.019420194,0.045402065,-0.0030078872,-0.013243279,0.08907794,0.06781369,0.0053953677,0.0432245,0.035010368,0.071746886,-0.046493653,-0.005040027,-0.021704448,-0.05983374,0.025615156,-0.05634822,-0.08227643,0.023524385,-0.044597358,0.08759859,-0.015824232,0.082746,0.050084382,-0.026635671,-0.1532074,0.022171898,-0.0019515915,0.06398678,-0.012687812,-0.0046944623,0.013988055,-0.010829823,0.033290252,-0.05011846,0.0488044,-0.029972391,-0.008203258,0.0935447,0.074425176,-0.011746242,-0.004416263,0.0077334438,0.03722754,-0.031856563,-0.030976094,0.07395737,-0.029181506,-0.07115072,-0.0065211854,0.021710103,0.014158854,0.02812635,0.06867701,-3.874615e-08,0.07464106,0.053792365,0.026970062,0.03446945,0.019440353,-0.033309367,0.03500017,-0.053528056,0.017802589,-0.08123782,-0.09248915,0.039009254,-0.036199685,-0.0075714523,0.011350135,0.019349057,0.0045742504,0.07079027,0.0053136856,0.02505367,-0.100292824,-0.038559943,-0.009494566,-0.07154538,-0.0373223,-0.032149985,-0.019494487,-0.030965079,0.089353904,0.053192105,-0.015500943,0.02719287,-0.012662289,0.0027173734,-0.07568022,0.035434812,-0.06060988,0.0037093076,-0.025153628,0.03159649,0.0036592963,-0.07707356,-0.03618552,0.0019514718,-0.10752541,-0.011789225,-0.007439669,-0.07318518,-0.012255526,0.073905006,0.056744404,-0.0073617175,0.025429279,-0.0252412,0.021578759,0.023232331,0.05211291,-0.018522779,0.059521444,-0.022805266,-0.01249991,0.027451338,0.10204661,0.0945087

"Iceberg lettuce, iceberg lettuce is 99% water so it's very, very juicy and crisp if it's a good one. [ping] It doesn't have a lot of flavor because it's just about all water. So cut it in half. Cut it in half again like that. 
Then thinly sliced. Wash the outside but you don't need to pull apart the leaves and wash it. There's no dirt or grit getting inside. A little bit goes a long way.",0.003444386,-0.032722097,0.03603426,0.03326661,-0.01275782,-0.055485543,-0.036178872,0.041002143,-0.059129525,0.036597326,-0.036649514,0.020463405,-0.019390346,-0.033233922,-0.012353453,-0.022810198,0.10518859,0.056507356,-0.12430264,-0.0798418,0.05233356,-0.023428177,0.049674757,-0.025975626,0.040462606,-0.04798694,0.013145131,0.055198327,-0.014048974,-0.116467394,0.042050384,0.00080460944,0.0112933535,-0.063104585,0.025236182,-0.0030083398,0.056289054,-0.1573404,0.058161646,-0.110300004,0.07086676,0.037796013,-0.028215725,0.0205792,0.01760752,-0.052909665,-0.08637466,0.055306833,0.08139324,-0.026492111,-0.025546284,-0.047334753,-0.09542397,-0.06192262,0.007827552,0.014770699,0.016261753,-0.04335882,0.042268142,0.02014935,0.0512643,-0.010580633,-0.00203604,-0.009775883,0.0027953717,-0.0055535915,-0.053500034,0.02682894,-0.015262611,0.015129303,0.033301737,0.050096206,-0.02572255,0.0066018132,-0.08472723,-0.07775196,-0.013963124,-0.016621536,-0.03255226,0.1758423,-0.025521865,0.029044637,0.028179167,0.034015812,-0.05097682,0.018841684,0.010485415,-0.029855967,0.033201724,-0.014075706,-0.015179242,-0.006388818,-0.0069912863,0.0018640656,-0.01146662,0.05800839,0.024828486,-0.058774605,-0.037264545,0.009238131,-0.031375963,-0.044056397,0.029337408,-0.09350205,-0.017706806,0.031645868,0.053040076,0.014073637,-0.0020362595,-0.03302552,-0.04726403,0.012465851,-0.08359815,0.022374991,0.014445779,-0.052176587,0.13963081,-0.0035096204,0.000511692,0.031548876,-0.01953002,-0.03635311,-0.02180798,0.08024961,0.0057582012,0.011466335,0.10229589,5.2067002e-34,0.015359354,0.030653708,0.03306328,-0.06888615,0.036844794,-0.017220221,0.01763714,-0.06225012,-0.026134258,0.09658852,0.01176499,-0.09313955,-0.07119592,0.010979622,-0.004033309,-0.03545548,-0.05943917,-0.016631557,-0.0009912268,0.08644161,0.006158615,0.04479699,-0.092447214,0.008544757,-0.012830792,-0.026440771,0.041903574,-0.055748183,0.0149561865,-0.020481031,0.12195764,0.07521039,-0.053105913,-0.008257329,-0.017968096,0.000873671,0.03156924,0.061118707,0.07686176,0.0749852,0.042675722,0.037513983,-0.04681374,0.0029050477,-0.02181241,-0.013861866,0.038615916,0.098667115,0.09923512,0.025863778,0.04456107,0.034005526,0.017576722,0.044584427,-0.053714182,-0.014321553,0.12181228,0.04517095,0.020743435,-0.03591152,0.007685222,-0.023971345,-0.015566762,-0.0031325724,-0.054086443,-0.0359207,-0.11979805,0.042841632,0.03215914,-0.037003007,-0.13894644,0.0106572015,0.0070996615,-0.07679643,-0.06145577,-0.034990553,-0.026154421,0.050047208,0.07355826,-0.0024461302,0.10862195,0.0019247199,-0.082952924,-0.034374494,-0.009294018,0.007063007,-0.15857506,0.052233428,0.061753962,0.018820515,0.004285193,-0.0359039,0.020108676,-0.022063786,0.011557222,-9.123602e-34,0.03735121,0.02039295,-0.009531318,0.17425552,0.05945047,-0.08227111,-0.11752924,0.067907184,0.011754303,-0.004168006,-0.0398088,0.0061724973,-0.0136242565,0.029931793,0.014919434,0.08879995,0.011320129,0.079840705,-0.003235623,-0.057069886,-0.091166064,-0.051880497,0.02541385,0.02299012,0.013172513,0.065772064,0.050858833,-0.035503123,0.042142555,-0.007136477,-0.017392553,-0.01186453,0.08144487,-0.037890054,-0.014093991,0.006802584,0.014656528,-0.033508964,0.07163284,0.055914544,8.348042e-05,0.02422934,0.0042400104,-0.010971336,-0.006228275,-0.051719245,0.021671979,-0.065480076,0.010488798,0.057875145,0.050474387,0.04241576,-0.02977102,0.056893867,-0.015977,-0.04522147,9.580848e-05,-0.05740965,-0.020486144,-0.011191759,-0.035337057,0.051386442,-0.04693684,0.043522228,0.0025790485,-0.009170656,-0.03732697,0.038652714,-0.07124376,0.062243484,-0.111887656,-0.016791824,0.067584574,-0.05868471,0.11829105,-0.009573719,-0.019925566,-0.047887057,-0.007924029,0.049243644,0.04198119,0.052136302,-0.049723662,-0.06781646,0.02303764,0.05910375,0.00057085656,0.02449173,-0.047486197,0.005987348,-0.04861161,-0.054595314,0.024902597,0.099775225,0.0009501312,-4.7127486e-08,0.03997746,-0.050570637,-0.037974276,0.10354905,-0.0100821555,-0.057037465,-0.036255877,-0.01568003,0.031648934,-0.0006070444,-0.047039643,0.0865567,-0.15623166,-0.005521804,0.03854025,-0.03256577,0.05432889,-0.010255139,0.03243324,0.036295842,-0.058103975,-0.03981467,0.079526104,-0.026186857,-6.754208e-05,0.05693243,0.033636525,0.039052546,0.084485345,0.049998134,-0.03069746,0.030005466,-0.066300474,-0.021894721,-0.018801177,-0.031058747,-0.019288467,0.03879594,0.0054254397,-0.016999621,-0.019546444,0.06300077,0.03553392,0.0063043386,-0.05853028,-0.043098968,-0.005725026,-0.036760934,-0.0038891176,0.052474562,0.017387608,-0.042826246,-0.063901365,0.009355203,-0.033765133,0.110664204,0.053988606,0.022894438,-0.056119747,-0.007458418,-0.08651502,0.0077919266,-0.009170991,-0.028623953
"Kale, this is lacinato kale. [ping] This kale is usually the most reliable and not too tough. So you just pinch off the leaves from here and then just run your hand down. 
Now, this kale can be sliced really thinly again and used raw or you can stir this into a nice white bean soup so it wilts at the end of cooking. You don't really wanna cook this ahead.",-0.0292692,-0.052653152,-0.011306986,0.067685254,0.00024864136,-0.007804811,0.006205187,0.0009898278,0.007044877,0.0047840085,0.018006582,-0.088129476,-0.036870632,-0.08759521,-0.032770615,-0.07461359,0.049176756,-0.0021534688,-0.02974668,-0.058941595,-0.008013675,0.036797974,0.005099423,0.0028599272,0.07947426,0.014603367,0.028455751,0.02106595,-0.01604783,-0.11757252,-0.027766984,0.011145117,-0.06846512,0.01812874,-0.05064341,0.02066701,-0.050371714,-0.03928486,0.067372814,-0.08158452,0.063787855,-0.053209703,0.036944192,-0.021227498,-0.026767528,0.0047104266,-0.039747838,0.03937098,0.024597814,-0.042866126,-0.044906627,-0.06403076,-0.10792369,-0.007566992,-0.007761716,0.018370897,-0.04774103,-0.05095388,0.09984434,0.1509773,0.012954192,0.009574487,0.0065975324,0.028267987,-0.024006028,-0.007441735,-0.027800454,-0.020645699,-0.0028268946,-0.00687527,0.0063576573,-0.020599658,-0.0033154683,0.025467684,-0.04776302,0.0055215247,0.023845132,-0.010040158,-0.00038753918,0.09016644,-0.02550497,0.035808675,-0.05828703,0.015220449,-0.049763743,0.057167187,0.0063335737,0.014953748,0.03976516,0.0006713697,0.018518282,0.11315311,0.0077740303,0.044015214,-0.09654145,0.025526306,0.058898278,-0.042552177,-0.08028391,0.028407222,-0.0114238765,-0.017075593,0.018454982,-0.07609369,-0.072806165,-0.095288426,0.0071555004,-0.1581627,0.028180623,-0.050277054,-0.061263144,0.038635794,-0.12464149,-0.037044834,-0.018812599,-0.03983095,0.085770816,-0.05299202,0.020343034,0.034516156,-0.031196432,-0.017208477,-0.039894637,0.0048529534,-0.05999709,-0.00720666,0.10198294,2.6124276e-33,0.01649239,0.075461976,0.12879232,-0.013755263,0.08590805,-0.056085195,-0.09339268,-0.020042438,-0.10163171,-0.031239718,-0.015148449,-0.114026144,-0.085396245,0.031096546,0.047894914,0.048512205,-0.053550817,-0.05754596,0.0008886137,0.049450375,0.04754003,0.014953363,-0.008498631,0.064721376,-0.010316517,-0.054206435,0.051409863,-0.041548215,-0.0036458268,0.04512454,0.027605623,-0.02253651,-0.030015698,0.00441146,-0.16410658,-0.02970405,-0.07010852,-0.03666138,-0.02603446,0.043835975,-0.033020474,-0.026348477,0.00062284095,0.089660846,-0.034634963,-0.015037257,0.010636653,0.04619405,0.027205633,0.018658644,0.0052865995,-0.026818866,0.12632689,0.031920094,-0.0051530804,0.09434771,0.11221115,0.064260796,0.020649385,0.010084531,0.11654506,0.0020950895,0.0040307525,0.060681466,0.0033298344,0.05000765,-0.117533386,-0.051811077,0.04317258,-0.058962446,-0.06756461,-0.03883462,0.065248705,-0.03038904,0.01087606,0.008498714,0.05822013,0.0307996,-0.012093251,-0.015277937,0.029809909,0.059074283,0.039319467,0.015647661,0.0011560814,0.008065825,-0.1097638,-0.0023321814,0.011345792,0.08622801,-0.06455853,0.031424765,-0.0025056596,-0.041404076,-0.028350431,-3.150542e-33,0.14984229,-0.03352,0.03582146,0.11557088,0.026428862,-0.061813965,-0.028426303,0.009237142,0.04433226,-0.0460243,0.0057010073,-0.05520567,0.04239652,-0.014291627,0.060540907,0.09120853,0.040916868,0.076388516,0.012980822,-0.01144183,-0.05956962,0.049630616,0.03313274,-0.022213623,-0.010421818,-0.04476921,0.065900736,0.0392847,-0.094733216,-0.037777927,0.020942204,-0.08679312,0.056721948,-0.06072617,-0.072734706,0.036024354,0.019520883,-0.09189004,0.07523407,0.057240646,0.011986664,0.07777839,-0.0051961807,0.011344784,-0.033488683,-0.0867015,0.020933766,-0.005761705,0.0010486091,0.012057481,0.10339334,0.0072406093,-0.05964633,0.023825506,0.036650203,0.054303057,0.007594996,0.015946792,-0.016491827,-0.008179396,-0.038143367,-0.0067632813,0.021380391,-0.0037172686,0.06369812,0.00215131,-0.036930967,0.01969227,-0.070732534,0.007429134,0.029855238,0.084006555,-0.06625154,0.0036747174,0.091660924,0.042247705,-0.03825321,0.055168547,-0.0370366,-0.00026166718,0.07981366,-0.0359702,-0.02579334,0.0023406048,0.051393088,0.011177425,-0.040134218,0.021114992,0.0657021,-0.021009434,-0.003626718,-0.030266844,-0.0043415218,0.06497304,0.058162194,-4.6743537e-08,0.059642307,-0.047092445,-0.09184867,0.018852286,0.04921279,-0.009918911,-0.026747817,-0.09638462,0.0801407,-0.096746266,-0.063839644,0.0054868613,0.014085352,0.04514299,-0.032679193,0.0034899658,-0.02057575,0.05999522,0.015758533,0.06144574,0.015091425,-0.04607693,0.08959762,-0.036576007,0.09061646,0.03213408,-0.023003502,0.017051363,0.019587286,-0.028704515,-0.03251902,0.009143064,-0.044609617,-0.0075103906,-0.021321906,0.09543855,-0.04760128,0.00037259492,-0.034482595,0.045136992,-0.007936403,-0.07538373,0.0055236793,-0.008728937,-0.1154577,0.0391945,-0.010455802,0.017440861,0.0020724793,-0.034565303,-0.064142466,0.006223634,0.062434677,0.054047946,0.0053073545,0.0033069765,0.03896798,0.0005909652,-0.00507176,0.0026281076,0.033614982,0.034003,-0.012925995,0.05640929
"It tastes better fresh. If you are roasting use this one, taking off the stems and breaking it into bite-size pieces. And then purple kale can be a little tough sometimes and I think it's better to cook it.
If you wanted to leave the stems in you can just cut them down the middle and then just cut across.

"Butternut squash, it's in season in fall and there's a lot of different things you can do with it. One of the best things to do with squash besides making soup is to roast to. 
You can leave the skin on but mostly I take it off and I like to put a towel down because when you start peeling it it bleeds and gets very sticky and slippery and you can slip and cut yourself if you're losing control of your peeler. 
So peeling it just the fell length like this.

"Tomatillo, tomatillos are a tomato family member and they have a husk on the outside that you need to peel off before you use them. 
You don't need a knife actually because the best way to prepare them is to boil them, blanche them until they burst or put them under a grill until the skins char a little bit.

You can just do it with your fingers and then you can decide do you want slices like this to be eaten raw as a snack, as a crudite or larger pieces that you might like to roast to then put on a sandwich or add to a salad.",-0.053920273,-0.08678593,-0.048174594,0.053116612,-0.05687212,0.020122211,-0.0352534,0.005043706,-0.05741821,-0.0064276466,0.09921652,-0.0404325,0.011467837,-0.041865528,0.013950021,-0.11786212,0.08215911,0.007120928,-0.03849838,-0.056582864,0.021668747,0.007315554,0.035752337,-0.0068441113,0.010927353,0.03206212,0.0013068152,-0.034291465,-0.007917918,-0.028330961,0.053390753,0.026970563,0.08886417,0.015370251,-0.070133306,0.009130342,-0.03837093,-0.007853491,0.10615199,-0.040483736,0.022959575,-0.03164435,0.0054956865,-0.006239245,0.057492208,-0.04181249,-0.032077838,-0.012249447,0.016403753,-0.06289251,-0.021625679,0.0793446,-0.013533156,0.0031053699,-0.0052385475,0.03657028,-0.052492157,-0.03105108,0.041719105,0.08969555,-0.045518428,-0.07740463,-0.012606036,0.010896546,-0.035672396,-0.038603567,-0.037950072,0.011352346,0.05699481,-0.028751269,-0.011580141,0.03182276,0.012403472,0.041301977,-0.023166928,0.0020526752,0.05722704,-0.009504876,-0.1293467,0.06443736,-0.068974614,0.026426151,-0.057679843,0.06170473,-0.034914836,0.09211096,-0.0055502295,-0.019050088,-0.032812495,0.07288894,0.0589036,0.017975654,-0.003955512,-0.0011511882,-0.05712366,0.030495215,0.04211294,-0.10195545,0.010427809,0.02191102,0.0017211667,-0.02939941,-0.055940393,-0.01397366,0.045901086,-0.08639598,0.017669816,-0.0034756826,-0.029668136,0.009308398,0.07964837,0.02156432,-0.0432099,-0.08169812,0.049307644,-0.055855017,0.05788026,-0.052809086,0.060191188,0.012496987,0.013118905,-0.067989975,-0.14952524,0.018107396,-0.043539364,0.0068733203,0.050622586,-1.3016006e-34,0.0026777193,0.09840862,0.013611046,0.013333795,-0.022483021,0.008561814,0.015719492,0.026850717,0.018465031,0.01169736,0.059706453,-0.04114381,-0.027246784,0.083610184,-0.026058821,-0.04677628,-0.03323797,0.061536923,0.027324632,-0.007286433,-0.024164444,0.0022817738,0.0399884,0.006349612,-0.008044979,0.0354755,-0.025550803,-0.13217355,0.02836373,-0.0069870604,-0.0012935367,0.021352047,0.028469285,0.08433807,0.007442022,0.0731662,-0.040603895,-0.003846608,-0.022790674,0.041969314,0.025614915,0.014792827,-0.04611635,0.024892153,0.006485283,0.016890218,0.0054163802,0.028502135,0.034719534,0.03782937,0.11285583,0.005848849,0.11988342,-0.021722207,0.028953893,0.06005894,0.10241573,-0.012050891,0.03729653,-0.07544658,-0.04784653,-0.009920528,-0.061963417,0.037739523,-0.023768438,0.040422536,-0.11876107,-0.085247695,0.06045482,-0.051333874,-0.012451258,-0.01061588,-0.019172814,0.011927133,-0.012761086,0.0729411,-0.059732676,0.049435303,0.051754955,-0.017375186,0.122250326,0.07468508,-0.032492213,-0.0037498416,0.05688531,0.026060484,-0.052490268,-0.0106110275,0.08398234,-0.049115364,-0.05307191,-0.039505027,0.07541915,-0.0314008,0.00038458905,1.552157e-34,0.023165012,0.049664315,-0.0016910359,0.057779312,0.017925845,-0.050472997,-0.12015116,-0.013300847,-0.020749534,-0.04510916,-0.09347739,-0.015107193,0.06775976,-0.07216343,-0.054014128,0.052732356,0.050617214,0.064371675,-0.04886706,0.031277,-0.10791176,-0.027361326,0.031447094,0.020045288,-0.037998855,0.02711296,0.06695819,0.010925855,0.043038134,-0.03847302,0.011783089,-0.068740614,0.05606666,-0.057660095,-0.0040466115,0.08786396,-0.065361254,0.015493854,0.096019395,-0.048079893,-0.10142486,-0.03435655,0.03008328,-0.010598917,-0.048086856,-0.01596207,0.058263198,0.008913575,-0.09421619,0.09264107,0.0031121278,-0.013413738,-0.057572212,-0.04373582,0.0111266365,-0.07876127,-0.053417537,-0.03502004,0.09039087,-0.09779494,-0.033744168,0.015472828,0.039844256,0.050432757,0.0086716,0.0012474405,0.014031555,0.0007591036,-0.04731692,-0.03403245,-0.0033084883,0.07494022,0.07860537,-0.09546535,0.08565163,-0.052843716,-0.04199206,-0.012349398,-0.0050665233,0.07179084,-0.014570746,0.015786866,-0.032381188,0.013127167,-0.028905915,0.069990866,0.007551814,0.056668982,-0.05975976,-0.0008548445,-0.06517764,0.024355331,0.11236102,0.102274194,0.12867667,-3.9477438e-08,0.06870156,-0.023318768,-0.05010408,0.106432706,0.019307556,0.033662234,-0.03100697,-0.09739756,0.03286451,0.00090357364,-0.024657097,0.039234065,-0.03548102,-0.01452358,-0.03953264,-0.021391444,-0.024556577,0.008488801,-0.020839784,0.095640875,0.03508882,-0.003088946,0.033844005,-0.02065445,0.12805948,-0.020158775,-0.03471397,-0.0211285,0.03831472,0.033536147,0.020285245,-0.03225938,0.023709655,0.023905523,0.027353296,-0.05731828,-0.011413661,0.0020008672,0.016675662,0.0056273537,0.01386619,-0.039488427,-0.036634102,0.015300554,-0.17624192,0.01685679,-0.09092259,0.016954029,-0.056418967,0.08544177,-0.016061796,-0.024583548,0.041259315,-0.08403752,-0.030701157,0.052849308,0.0809472,0.011959241,-0.005011856,0.029128103,-0.08637779,0.059374835,-0.014763738,0.043858673
"Jalapeno pepper, the best way, I think, to cut this is to just go around the seeds, like this, just roll it. The seeds are really spicy. The flesh may or may not be spicy. 
You really just have to test it by going like this just to see if it's burning your tongue. So you can slice it up like this in long strips and then just dice it and then you can use that in a salsa like that. 
And that's peppers.",-0.04697503,-0.033327937,-0.06931687,0.040406503,-0.06519262,-0.0056357915,-0.027399024,-0.038477473,-0.020574333,0.018732402,0.10038332,-0.048335224,0.0049451725,0.037720233,0.030576613,-0.08188021,0.057487506,0.05291739,-0.014473827,-0.087734886,0.07183513,0.02521857,0.017783618,-0.0059747277,0.010918887,0.0067838435,0.013327426,0.027907899,-0.0019605556,-0.051920187,0.07484532,0.004909754,0.006439155,-0.031631734,-0.00065693026,-0.055072047,-0.053043533,-0.020900471,0.10350671,0.006696926,0.043373615,0.025698429,0.07991673,0.021967327,0.11781974,-0.07433885,-0.039757274,-0.016103724,0.07102856,-0.022145573,-0.065689266,-0.04296322,-0.041301835,0.038573083,-0.013145358,-0.013410867,-0.04153672,-0.06487494,-0.0044370294,0.07774198,-0.005353255,-0.046126775,0.0018593395,-0.02467292,-0.085969165,-0.03279128,0.047720995,0.016126461,0.039277732,0.015673142,-0.01990952,-0.0014942758,-0.0039936067,0.05874405,-0.0067926794,-0.014619911,0.008751413,-0.036734525,-0.082202286,0.011833472,0.00926882,-0.022193514,-0.04862837,0.048785232,-0.021078723,0.10581273,-0.04048307,-0.019726845,-0.036631666,0.07778301,0.037037984,0.06575206,0.021452768,-0.047584206,-0.017544607,0.032983012,-0.02814539,-0.06562326,-0.050122418,0.00091449695,0.054446883,-0.08228718,-0.12049962,-0.04451156,0.00975712,-0.028795939,0.039391592,-0.062444463,-0.029262494,-0.014830162,-0.013719166,0.06504341,-0.109968536,-0.09907357,-0.023344666,0.027851563,0.11381975,0.052879225,0.05616719,0.028844908,-0.005443176,-0.017734095,-0.08351516,0.03043737,0.002725551,0.009175287,0.05389733,-1.796058e-33,0.07925262,0.12043871,-0.033687767,-0.018912528,0.014066783,0.014728779,-0.0007095133,0.041290425,-0.07219798,-0.009920868,0.015656905,-0.08204655,-0.037791006,0.12682924,0.031089025,-0.06826877,-0.029060591,-0.0028670987,-0.05978697,-0.06485397,0.0059893397,0.01821255,0.055276603,0.06601224,0.00020095348,0.0089242095,-0.06699986,-0.071855314,-0.019598415,0.010739151,-0.024862554,0.009884099,0.011367625,0.01572875,0.037926674,0.024161972,0.022572756,0.0010853065,-0.02019908,0.03422987,-0.0029729893,0.013272883,-0.036746092,0.049975928,-0.033217717,-0.037676774,0.019908909,0.03496416,0.09113123,0.015689272,0.09445221,0.035295524,0.12155476,0.010948237,-0.024796573,0.015935266,0.036104288,0.01529575,0.045211595,-0.07903644,0.00040702737,-0.025751771,-0.043956906,0.073280066,-0.07325804,0.018229876,-0.10127188,-0.0021041576,0.062288217,-0.08046473,-0.0371989,0.012256549,-0.031851627,0.0035168484,-0.02241514,0.032357916,0.02332694,0.06271817,0.01484814,-0.07606576,0.05155173,0.027249243,0.026770547,-0.014336825,0.054598343,0.09273841,-0.032642636,0.036592215,0.07651326,-0.017211648,-0.06406779,0.006896123,0.03899744,-0.021783797,0.059353504,4.4845996e-34,-0.03457954,0.05870645,0.05999219,0.085180245,0.012787844,-0.1113229,-0.07478518,0.0086353,0.019588077,-0.07783786,-0.07142139,-0.043162122,0.061045017,-0.09851479,-0.03220026,-0.018257694,0.007666474,0.046889685,-0.0043420373,0.038219806,-0.18155076,-0.040557627,0.07857089,0.017234808,0.031690527,0.024294028,0.08982252,-0.060092002,0.026220055,-0.013747972,-0.016615758,-0.08093289,0.024728427,-0.07502476,-0.016192162,0.10598008,-0.07354403,0.047655202,0.05118838,-0.015650893,-0.023496684,-0.039889243,-0.037312105,0.018323632,-0.019734584,-0.027223712,-0.016175188,0.028436115,-0.057490688,0.08850116,0.026124137,0.043286268,-0.053768292,0.023736894,0.060994007,-0.13589717,-0.036414903,-0.0059779147,0.036775243,-0.04041168,-0.051134553,0.006163951,-0.011658317,0.04153425,0.11122576,0.005679658,0.044939656,0.037838597,-0.06353189,0.026217947,-0.008007159,0.07930846,-0.007343212,-0.013635364,0.025631314,-0.07111521,-0.07335436,0.002866471,0.0078146495,0.063374564,0.05926243,-0.029894758,-0.03935771,-0.06624864,-0.001975522,0.0034977403,-0.029250601,0.047740847,0.04643886,-0.06461623,-0.017416636,0.0074043055,0.036400154,0.0028314698,0.043616008,-4.165133e-08,0.13691235,-0.025717504,-0.054028954,0.09340674,0.022109222,-0.009039007,-0.032177422,-0.10011791,0.05067851,-0.0030987689,0.009854835,0.057707734,-0.0026528826,0.019010877,-0.063620515,-0.07287098,0.011025682,0.08929164,0.032355905,0.056395575,-0.022995144,-1.0433128e-05,0.009635511,-0.065116726,0.06265491,-0.047104944,-0.05697616,0.0013090749,0.053428393,-0.008218152,0.009027776,-0.06456291,0.013615313,0.022140263,-0.019986289,0.028517723,-0.051748905,0.035268996,0.021055449,0.035473883,0.005619542,-0.056903075,-0.018775756,-0.010908564,-0.1659991,-0.03646597,0.028911578,-0.020219633,-0.033564825,0.09840271,0.028457195,-0.08409482,0.07618556,-0.057327416,-0.03504561,0.03249407,0.09719756,0.019279864,0.018134056,-0.023762962,-0.0941014,0.022780865,-0.016770579,0.06743636
"Bitter melon, bitter melon is a member of the watermelon family. It can be eaten in a variety of ways. You don't need to peel it. You do need to take out the seeds though.
So I would cut it longways like this and take out these seeds by scraping with a spoon, just like you would, say, a squash.

If they're not in season I recommend cutting them how you wanna cut them, mixing them with salt and set aside for an hour to drain to get out a bitter taste and then rinsing them really well before you prepare them.",0.03931799,-0.013267492,0.04019175,-0.03373667,-0.0764809,0.032357696,-0.035899796,0.010361645,-0.047790177,-0.019362662,-0.008743522,-0.024335131,-0.120682515,-0.08049455,-0.0054813256,-0.058733277,0.085692585,0.012554924,-0.044453,-0.008243559,-0.00034021123,-0.05157758,0.020634575,-0.011084643,0.0568556,0.022100873,-0.039364427,0.084926225,0.032278236,-0.0092263045,0.0130803725,0.011079666,0.024118692,-0.03905605,-0.0039215386,0.023369286,0.034014948,-0.04938499,0.03391105,-0.034252975,0.17107585,0.017053815,-0.01323624,-0.07475995,0.011493845,-0.05421975,-0.035027098,-0.11420704,-0.01917775,-0.023437234,-0.00044838584,0.029637655,0.031788163,-0.044849973,-0.05379635,-0.010486113,-0.02008294,-0.05107925,0.074584246,0.0013883256,-0.03925894,-0.048151772,0.019102218,-0.076960444,-0.05753598,-0.02738589,-0.033258393,0.01871906,0.03515823,0.039576784,-0.05730674,0.10715475,-0.011193347,0.027279012,-0.075229436,0.006831875,0.03386764,-0.068343505,-0.03569214,0.07500393,-0.027228573,-0.013082475,-0.024238773,-0.017250331,-0.017555704,-0.027448172,0.046275053,0.06981454,-0.014109304,0.004534469,0.070531316,0.08647709,0.03270184,0.079234816,0.10331905,-0.036182556,0.029780546,-0.06964862,-0.00824062,-0.024425324,0.053878885,-0.025164042,-0.0026387973,-0.064346,0.054157782,-0.013683757,-0.02374175,-0.089325644,0.008067427,0.0072331415,-0.04212822,-0.03552839,0.022920195,-0.032129858,0.029880341,0.0065809283,-0.04122542,0.06519085,-0.04706851,-0.027958114,-0.0060761347,-0.050418913,0.032032035,-0.005608563,0.0202127,-0.0385236,-0.049695157,2.1698942e-33,0.04550345,0.14514571,-0.07911121,0.035986394,0.004870153,0.0066519254,-0.038924683,0.024567865,-0.03361962,0.04219237,0.027436506,-0.013853532,-0.07228845,0.04941257,-0.026119286,0.007291562,0.01713368,-0.0068354546,-0.035644613,0.006369406,-0.048515275,-0.011867914,-0.06423958,0.008782253,-0.08078309,-0.009413338,-0.014532618,-0.029848786,-0.0887079,-0.01942561,0.092981614,-0.03338489,0.001512731,-0.002249472,0.073928334,0.07632451,0.021173744,-0.0009845676,0.020080121,0.0532979,-0.0025284674,-0.055031803,0.010626435,0.114402615,0.024925062,0.029754743,-0.01518783,0.10664345,0.111818075,-0.0032053245,0.033795845,0.035073757,0.0039838967,-0.022519035,-0.0034274522,0.025318364,-0.016844489,-0.013733218,0.012594371,-0.03713455,-0.08001486,-0.03755632,-0.039165776,0.05248867,-0.109704085,0.004589409,-0.099774644,0.018665217,0.0108132325,-0.03917596,-0.031519227,-0.10789257,0.011914223,0.014626005,0.008841565,0.0392006,0.07512076,0.06017187,-0.022686945,0.04202007,0.100560844,0.11173763,-0.049897723,-0.029752877,-0.009330263,-0.025644582,-0.06938324,0.046482798,0.0699845,0.0420481,0.04549202,-0.0773153,0.02294383,0.033156198,-0.010135944,-2.5977018e-33,0.012416261,0.02372407,-0.08306524,0.054975417,-0.013050432,-0.0073617715,-0.024968496,0.006682926,-0.006010081,-0.014108972,-0.003936644,-0.071136534,0.034743838,-0.028062904,-0.018221943,-0.018273467,0.08807651,0.09333894,0.06771255,-0.045704324,-0.1330494,0.047297616,0.013275772,0.03868093,-0.020899395,0.094008505,0.06639845,-0.13533325,-0.05801779,-0.0135045815,-0.04652511,-0.041803703,-0.039739687,-0.062154666,-0.003325037,0.078960426,-0.031793997,-0.06395486,-0.043059,0.056392487,-0.09349333,0.04008854,0.038692456,0.01904372,0.016649602,-0.056528628,0.08145292,-0.005863571,-0.013439093,0.12736242,0.019933017,0.033952896,-0.023609273,-0.03594424,0.0774271,-0.06328119,-0.005773152,-0.0866856,-0.00028132217,-0.018499123,-0.038501907,-0.01608145,0.12783115,0.046777252,-0.04376965,0.012991848,0.00944454,0.008034069,0.08808256,-0.016658822,-0.06733822,0.08883182,0.07985384,-0.0036004386,0.039326437,0.047283422,-0.07270519,-0.05521454,0.016966786,-0.0032493602,-0.0024313773,0.07391185,-0.017245864,-0.019405004,-0.1052223,-0.04887185,-0.009645779,0.034064345,-0.052882425,-0.0067372695,0.009780835,-0.0034810824,-0.005325446,0.12365421,-0.0035214066,-4.2796245e-08,0.087686695,0.07410138,-0.013428341,0.05341736,-0.015866345,-0.010341238,-0.07432238,-0.112949476,0.03725852,-0.0017320054,-0.08944988,0.05430473,-0.075271934,-0.034867533,-0.036042344,0.012932942,0.061327867,0.027811242,-0.0242471,0.008455076,-0.050452776,0.047386046,0.020275915,0.03316705,0.11387186,-0.005939521,0.06275981,0.03300306,0.03547739,0.071456045,-0.02692906,-0.018514486,-0.03760292,-0.057794884,0.010430385,0.018411728,-0.02260439,0.012285897,-0.0151588665,-0.065100856,0.038493175,-0.047926087,0.06737807,0.028145557,-0.10936175,0.0037107705,-0.0063276524,-0.009751355,-0.02317651,0.04165334,0.0059552323,-0.08808107,0.06494783,0.010046593,-0.02710733,0.02086174,0.05353405,0.045457624,0.01661181,-0.011585994,-0.13815852,0.08223326,0.028702717,0.013921482
"They are often sliced and pan fried. You do need a lot of oil to roast or fry them 'cause they are spongy and absorbent. So if you were to do that for a sandwich, say, you would just slice it like this.
And after you've salted it and drained it, if you need to do that, you then pan fry them. If I was gonna roast it I cut it into sort of wedge shapes like this.
So there's a lot of different ways to use eggplant, but not raw, you don't wanna eat it raw.

"Radish, radishes are delicious eaten raw however you can roast them or saute them. So I love to shave them by plucking off the end.

You could also cut it like a carrot.",0.00043652556,0.025327835,-0.024128241,0.02019375,-0.039814483,-0.04498583,0.057921816,-0.016872203,-0.061588317,0.01700685,-0.048191357,-0.057541553,-0.093034685,-0.01045835,-6.724316e-05,-0.11140592,0.06884055,-0.019850144,0.08918102,-0.015286625,-0.00970479,5.174098e-05,0.0015003969,-0.03712581,0.06312921,-0.03976086,0.026348934,0.106515765,-0.052105784,-0.014602875,0.09139139,-0.07213929,-0.034143668,0.03770344,-0.058859345,-0.028547043,-0.006769712,0.07744392,0.024325496,0.014337802,0.06760416,0.015468317,0.007947571,-0.03301865,0.11677938,0.059531275,-0.028897217,0.0027423217,0.016002953,-0.007752825,-0.026210306,-0.0476221,-0.045561686,-0.014116425,-0.111905396,-0.0073451307,-0.068165325,-0.013616446,0.018254647,-0.03229768,-0.030481933,-0.0036815645,0.018716313,0.0030067537,-0.004789497,-0.0677846,0.04101703,0.011053287,0.010811261,0.042933185,0.040949505,0.05500953,0.031073436,-0.033038545,-0.09674768,-0.043313466,0.06809932,0.010317014,-0.03922154,0.10585472,-0.017138045,0.08538353,-0.03964494,0.06486649,-0.12411794,0.10641371,0.02411542,-0.048604574,-0.015903853,0.011238767,0.07095179,0.10421462,0.01878045,0.03194817,0.039070416,0.047480453,0.0749552,-0.07683902,0.011280115,0.00041822004,-0.020403609,-0.12938954,-0.047894523,-0.09523814,-0.01963657,-0.029366372,-0.006731431,0.011881426,-0.00062586844,-0.07672153,0.01801004,0.086888894,-0.038243167,-0.06021955,0.046328496,0.0049347593,0.09309432,-0.00016642064,-0.004782949,0.028516866,-0.059522633,-0.014782512,0.015886337,0.05147782,-0.036940075,0.042470645,0.09794234,-5.059892e-36,0.017442133,0.14050029,-0.00095179526,-0.046997357,0.02973004,0.028771596,-0.044705857,0.006416059,-0.0655949,0.059059575,0.045042843,-0.09261266,-0.016820459,0.04696328,0.0017892193,-0.019239789,0.009044071,-0.010858777,0.039291974,-0.053545747,-0.010832267,-0.04849183,0.041599847,-0.0034435585,-0.021806493,0.042234734,-0.0076771704,-0.03514003,0.03157778,-0.010656331,0.0100039765,-0.04430717,-0.019899106,-0.009847209,-0.051689032,-0.027630305,0.027029399,0.009303799,0.02731472,-0.012338513,0.015002647,-0.015107358,0.022821724,0.0031504866,-0.00030576755,0.03449949,-0.050341703,0.12443912,0.049697503,-0.024298703,0.094371416,0.05905552,0.12296084,-0.085127026,-0.048813485,0.0136394,0.08086961,0.014400588,0.049657147,0.017529914,0.07169805,-0.032012608,0.014243053,0.004609095,-0.09235122,0.008261753,-0.08702837,-0.02261164,-0.020967668,-0.09633851,-0.09101234,0.007331733,0.09870585,-0.08578516,-0.06060093,0.034266006,0.07622448,0.066508986,0.0060928394,-0.0038688937,0.016351951,0.059976056,-0.077838466,-0.0025018828,0.043653194,-0.008754803,-0.052543044,0.03854986,0.063733116,0.013040777,-0.07839963,-0.005805145,-0.03392575,-0.064827174,-0.012155615,-1.1790988e-34,-0.006766839,-0.028392024,-0.016338153,0.10123023,-0.0009956438,-0.09083647,-0.019254547,0.043438848,-0.023661936,-0.061711386,-0.042816635,-0.04873241,0.022424567,-0.00805798,-0.014163469,0.07008991,0.02624369,0.0867843,0.0048431344,-0.07567634,-0.049517367,-0.014526923,0.050443485,0.06562804,0.020766692,0.0012080355,0.04693549,0.0075325384,-0.020315608,-0.020391522,0.020413455,-0.083240554,0.074371,-0.04248925,-0.046570063,0.11992494,0.028561538,-0.019061808,0.03201912,-0.008542603,0.016383298,-0.06296397,-0.08244243,0.059104767,0.020161813,0.005415423,-0.014730648,0.02168392,-0.009792863,0.08596736,0.07915214,-0.07146503,0.006302464,0.0026733675,0.039228488,-0.043922633,0.015327716,-0.039099406,0.015632559,-0.01304417,-0.04367502,-0.025104903,0.06032858,0.041142907,0.029055977,-0.0034238873,-0.0045492253,-0.06036291,-0.031789917,0.04383646,-0.06859665,-0.010099857,-0.06657838,0.01417201,0.044890102,0.022527523,0.100686125,0.051224757,-0.011991118,0.021055026,0.04649329,-0.058510277,0.0018597272,-0.033588964,0.07444933,0.022935819,-0.018661918,0.04409276,-0.04955186,-0.037534982,-0.039148573,-0.009981153,0.047936663,0.030613111,0.076796934,-4.59597e-08,0.022949003,-0.063307635,0.024441568,0.029732708,-0.026507966,0.08744975,0.051555425,-0.1514982,0.071079,-0.062916085,-0.13731968,-0.0023711445,0.015325515,0.08732273,0.020188175,0.01755471,0.046992276,0.0006939337,-0.026261082,-0.024698187,0.042772975,-0.029652018,0.04206029,-0.014529221,0.07980178,-0.071613766,0.014840835,-0.005473825,-0.03169198,0.05880252,-0.07348354,-0.008046149,-0.09917947,0.0062795985,0.06398527,0.053823043,-0.04327853,-0.006772799,-0.02523582,0.047299236,-0.05754001,-0.0024951778,-0.047279593,-0.052178886,-0.15151134,-0.028593097,-0.025533823,-0.0268822,-0.019236187,0.081230275,0.07040726,-0.06314602,0.027415795,-0.002497614,-0.06656843,-7.2886876e-05,0.062309545,-0.04302273,0.07506438,-0.014804938,0.010134475,0.037682477,-0.0058541796,0.036317788
"Turnip, turnip can be used in all the ways you would a parsnip, a carrot, even a potato. Although it has a little bit more of a pungent flavor and a lot of people don't love it.
It does need to be peeled. [peeler grinding on turnip] I would take off the end, cut it in half and then I would cut it like this into sort of wedges and then into odd shapes.

"Rutabaga, rutabagas which are also called swedes in England [ping] are an unusual vegetable. They sort of get stronger and a bit spicier tasting if that makes any sense, or sort of more pungent as they age.
And they're often mislabeled as turnips or golden turnips, don't be fooled. They are a starchy root vegetable so they can be made into a pureed vegetable soup.",0.030310819,-0.013811101,-0.11543004,0.10313294,-0.04296428,-0.07629093,0.07698205,-0.027288934,0.051372413,-0.044817522,0.06025577,-0.044878468,-0.04276445,-0.028367827,0.00039215927,-0.045301627,0.067830876,-0.021338768,-0.010874867,0.050968237,0.0057971342,-0.043345653,0.014033451,0.022524033,-0.016221326,0.05141494,0.04452008,-0.012900469,-0.028830675,-0.044449557,0.004089958,-0.0062412643,0.004166657,-0.0071376087,0.005121452,0.054667473,0.05887251,0.0035737928,-0.025367595,0.054891866,0.004260093,-0.058768142,0.07590732,-0.05085992,0.0007346381,0.010696881,-0.13412085,0.060130566,0.02137309,-0.018800167,0.008790938,-0.06771919,-0.024762537,-0.023825107,0.024784027,-0.048990555,-0.009531098,-0.022022102,0.0748185,0.011483018,0.05197521,-0.03136265,0.030267233,-0.007322021,-0.09123159,-0.040670574,-0.022932937,-0.020680772,-0.008574729,0.032747895,-0.0113568185,0.00385768,-0.044503916,0.07287884,-0.03390663,-0.026321746,-0.020060746,0.062253855,-0.05680535,-0.001429534,-0.051947698,0.018882185,-0.007592609,0.016130997,-0.00017430451,0.017296499,0.011691064,-0.041148838,0.034609266,-0.033834893,0.0057686316,0.06828144,0.048679467,0.034888916,-0.07400428,0.0007096284,0.053704035,-0.057571277,-0.08206999,0.019059706,-0.01883942,-0.0684476,0.040201277,0.049386498,0.009331628,-0.030400114,-0.11536707,-0.044316445,0.043149095,-0.04519893,-0.028134603,0.012410481,-0.004715604,-0.03246932,-0.045615833,-0.044966016,-0.031829197,-0.0102393115,-0.07803041,0.04274976,-0.020870501,0.087854296,-0.07474327,-0.054829158,0.09758446,-0.01969682,-0.07718304,-1.6766091e-34,0.020548347,0.032751493,-0.03715626,0.026537213,0.038409397,-0.03741011,-0.06346594,-0.035386294,-0.008369338,-0.023983069,0.0045666588,-0.023244366,-0.03491253,0.020252889,0.071692795,0.13796143,-0.007907497,-0.055582177,0.057038363,0.0039202888,-0.017469183,-0.018318744,0.13209637,-0.0724427,-0.04231147,-0.029641472,0.0026178714,-0.117441155,0.04381322,0.021806551,0.07747698,-0.031466663,0.0076028015,0.05472497,-0.07121504,0.0059011024,0.012147743,-0.09816125,-0.07857231,0.06785341,-0.016310051,-0.07509709,-0.05206837,0.023532439,0.019323336,-0.057604153,0.046959627,0.05701758,0.027493408,0.0226858,2.4582318e-05,0.021687295,0.061019894,0.037371177,-0.049134627,0.038610965,0.07926678,0.051634572,-0.0028032563,0.013538413,0.02242882,0.08443288,-0.008752984,-0.07127332,0.051451545,-0.030319506,-0.005267179,-0.01813162,-0.0072817532,-0.026162948,0.04633093,-0.089178756,0.040697947,0.075465456,-0.0530166,-0.042175174,0.021589072,0.046128135,0.06590325,0.040380314,0.048432976,0.011070976,0.0005223949,-0.06359892,-0.09267116,0.03711353,-0.017331446,-0.12593801,0.0150015885,-0.0032002549,-0.026032384,-0.007817204,-0.038282987,-0.075756565,-0.07303231,-3.6990436e-34,0.04225445,-0.023445973,-0.07540073,0.10807862,0.09888565,-0.054271597,-0.038721535,0.024606274,-0.00817038,0.0116755115,-0.016022991,-0.07774171,-0.010562103,0.005399638,0.11154932,0.056541886,0.098982684,0.06899244,0.030068291,-0.089065544,-0.024778929,0.026103469,0.025634406,0.04327441,-0.033525668,-0.03441385,0.092396565,0.00842887,-0.10702188,-0.05100823,0.0067414497,-0.00943255,0.024317216,-0.05405197,-0.012908416,0.04866182,-0.08824027,-0.030387133,0.08029392,-0.013132654,-0.043920565,-0.03942743,-0.005632661,0.004114795,0.044279534,-0.07467808,-0.042123992,0.11715833,-0.05324204,-0.056546707,0.074376754,0.019655451,-0.0009450571,0.054854307,-0.0023238156,-0.0426432,-0.06967846,0.0016433574,0.02658371,0.0022645956,-0.02543802,0.04146801,-0.0012056368,0.064472176,0.035023592,0.04561392,-0.03383995,-0.10709445,-0.0036014237,0.023633085,0.11505971,-0.042386174,0.015404267,0.009643995,0.0072619296,-0.0071606184,0.00016388556,0.023337848,0.014119273,-0.035578597,-0.016635936,-0.013483294,0.09867607,0.0444873,0.04345276,-0.028346201,-0.0748798,0.04485145,0.08154993,0.05443478,0.08783748,-0.022881988,-0.004972375,0.07755653,0.18448281,-3.580643e-08,0.06666313,-0.0134418905,-0.0721027,0.02415994,0.054481648,-0.06359484,0.018031886,-0.069229305,-0.029669166,0.026862694,-0.053867776,0.00884637,-0.041072037,-0.0008977021,0.0342144,0.13261777,0.055645153,0.07479264,-0.031483926,0.0575393,0.050239064,-0.005597379,0.072508045,-0.00089264306,0.00017993398,-0.04872356,-0.019382995,-0.07022197,0.084322006,-0.022008045,-0.009165313,0.018446252,0.035552688,-0.026344122,0.032976545,0.057059243,-0.061615862,0.023951048,0.0051148506,0.022554144,-0.07024034,-0.008302775,0.0028886774,-0.012229372,-0.12727565,0.030850172,-0.1333729,0.024310837,-0.02483146,-0.032335717,0.0033867394,5.7005993e-05,0.082527444,0.023199702,-0.092642635,0.011673637,0.043957535,-0.02057795,0.02126943,0.07036392,-0.011197587,0.012155067,0.04239467,0.051943585
"I actually love to steam them when they're freshly harvested and then blend with cauliflower and use it as a topping instead of potato for like a Shepherd's Pie.
But you can just cut them like this when you're cooking them in a soup. Add them to sauteed onions and garlic, any flavors you want and then add the rutabaga, water, cook till tender and blend.

"Cauliflower, cauliflower is part of the broccoli cruciferous family. The best way to prepare it is to cut off the leaves like that and you can just go around. And then you wanna cut off each floret too like that.
You can just go around and cut them off. If you turn it into cauliflower rice break it up into smaller florets or cut it and then put it in a food processor and grind it until it's light and fluffy. 
Don't overdo it 'cause it'll just end up mushy, that's cauliflower.",0.016352648,-0.031500548,0.008487811,0.03202387,-0.011501756,-0.07360508,-0.06538809,-0.015473009,-0.046393476,-0.027462227,0.093080185,-0.11016152,0.01588224,-0.07297938,-0.03525275,-0.073197335,0.025157113,0.023976546,-0.030421985,-0.06040323,0.019816807,-0.0070579266,-0.035193622,0.06809397,0.038745303,-0.0036040498,-0.033802506,-0.01592168,-0.02675511,-0.05872196,-0.024839075,0.019851966,0.0196627,0.021915128,-0.026520174,0.071634956,-0.027346011,-0.04558239,0.11509031,-0.059133638,0.006953751,0.008826122,0.081889614,-0.022529071,-0.00787405,0.03547181,-0.04324493,0.038035855,-0.0040654256,0.0010003353,-0.0041408786,-0.039714854,-0.07469188,0.047269214,-0.05036114,0.024769833,-0.065759264,0.031834505,-0.0057701445,0.054986693,-0.054642268,0.016305288,0.039498646,-0.03374091,-0.07903036,0.0109887635,-0.11711567,0.010638837,0.06293749,0.07461182,0.015286898,0.044333283,0.053137172,0.046478275,-0.043212533,0.0092098005,-0.020025255,-0.04284646,-0.0063967076,0.032157976,-0.017179245,0.08128979,0.06705042,-0.011430029,0.030711211,0.031575818,0.027196817,0.0071527334,0.009171698,0.015855262,0.06073115,0.03393957,-0.015208142,0.014835142,-0.10893627,-0.016753675,0.053948365,-0.083742514,-0.04808528,-0.060956337,0.0044800667,-0.03760103,0.0911571,-0.08206718,-0.033736035,-0.034228064,-0.020218506,-0.034188636,-0.036258712,-0.040467698,0.009140237,0.03933981,-0.0795793,-0.057293527,0.009468731,0.076231405,0.015762638,-0.035782173,-0.065254174,0.025809718,-0.028278943,-0.083143026,-0.08417619,-0.07875575,-0.07164379,-0.03513507,-0.009522742,2.5304219e-33,-0.01599185,0.06933383,-0.014073175,-0.0014779965,0.02690844,-0.068179086,0.011248566,-0.09078833,-0.002964882,-0.0137027865,0.05461316,-0.038769204,-0.06139318,0.050477445,0.030968746,-0.056846477,-0.076226726,-0.016940897,0.0016674501,0.014706494,0.031193696,0.030397382,-0.07381849,-0.038985677,-0.038594767,-0.012260951,0.018407807,-0.0147634735,-0.027762674,0.028223587,0.03473776,0.049963873,-0.04064856,0.055421434,-0.007718815,-0.024472473,0.02066766,-0.07790982,0.032775566,0.10292611,0.02842452,0.057662472,0.02806209,0.046258613,-0.02507922,0.036866106,0.03828427,0.0900179,0.07788258,-0.03368641,0.057845872,0.040635988,0.09083844,0.0106136715,0.029559692,-0.012392721,0.033132005,-0.06220015,-0.03573315,-0.0067807874,0.057918545,-0.058691975,0.017356632,0.03588059,-0.065997496,0.00968157,-0.10378908,-0.012906285,-0.0131958,-0.018475238,-0.03548667,-0.069743924,0.021432238,-0.049555838,-0.0063017453,0.028567424,0.11183849,0.03984493,-0.02874147,-0.0007786549,0.08342337,0.05553606,0.0048250426,-0.078921385,0.009857519,0.047965564,-0.08898532,0.108059384,0.025552379,-0.0040544234,-0.030502664,-0.043266937,0.09666021,0.059805203,-0.09871192,-1.1756343e-33,0.039035734,0.030665109,0.07488035,0.044744838,-0.026229387,-0.004348534,-0.053568706,-0.06041382,0.09197393,0.0020003398,-0.0883011,0.021494817,0.052001383,-0.031347875,-0.028458778,0.07821869,0.08250331,0.07187237,0.00840887,-0.037904378,-0.10499176,0.0038734062,-0.029198157,-0.03832323,-0.04497964,0.03144996,-0.046328377,-0.02464468,0.021002114,0.0331419,-0.047896363,-0.1505916,0.08801187,-0.02672486,-0.06566155,0.004826574,0.0028195642,-0.03701643,0.084078364,0.07004544,0.0008103412,-0.03837359,0.03306865,0.045005467,-0.005397654,-0.094725184,-0.0057285805,0.013726307,-0.05677086,0.046983674,0.0041740844,0.01266366,-0.005994405,-0.010090343,-0.0060589286,-0.005275605,-0.01125114,0.040613826,-0.070837125,-0.020441126,-0.057190046,-0.009513949,0.03055213,0.041049033,0.081829816,0.03956025,-0.07375968,0.0028478962,-0.044574156,0.0868363,-0.05335885,0.057914257,-0.0055633914,0.03646099,0.13831244,-0.02717331,-0.0054485993,0.020440819,0.009058636,0.07927942,0.048483297,-0.011024129,0.038796205,-0.016226696,-0.017500902,0.063322864,-0.046015713,0.0038448435,0.036144886,0.021650087,0.00056284777,-0.051853828,0.13811506,0.085767165,0.08957308,-4.376141e-08,0.10092224,-0.082575895,-0.025698114,0.00072278915,0.0035154582,-0.025784066,-0.03160413,-0.06126167,0.05057687,-0.061770223,-0.1254672,0.06446924,0.037120696,0.01237436,-0.035865325,-0.00027826722,0.070740335,0.07201325,-0.010631868,0.03621382,-0.07725125,-0.043724746,0.049387123,-0.000721357,0.11110323,0.088025324,0.048585285,0.006139404,-0.060656566,0.091003224,-0.019671222,-0.052430574,-0.02527174,-0.0702231,-0.0046750503,0.068222925,-0.08761119,0.028546711,-0.05322097,0.040218674,0.051992863,0.020900672,0.032555874,0.044319756,-0.021354022,0.025731264,-0.0265688,-0.045592718,0.02002988,0.092441455,0.02450634,-0.030727692,0.035816263,-0.02238286,-0.043664634,0.028723583,0.08112933,0.018276246,0.027540216,-0.029206827,-0.048986673,0.10996191,0.08934284,0.024692958
"Romanesco, romanesco is a variety of cauliflower and has basically the same flavor. It's much harder to cut into florets, however, you can do it but they join quite close together at the top.
I do the same thing I do with cauliflower and take off the leaves and the stem. I would just cut it into wedges. This is what it looks like inside, so it's not green all the way through. And just cut it like this and roast pieces like that. 
That is romanesco.",0.001707667,-0.006813818,-0.024133345,0.000416017,0.045736816,-0.080795474,-0.02322725,0.049521253,-0.0009767945,-0.055273157,0.014111861,-0.11334802,-0.07740333,-0.005938864,0.013127499,-0.14186639,0.01600734,0.041935004,0.016984105,-0.008470462,0.0035160033,-0.02997073,2.5640393e-05,0.080968015,0.03716909,0.009774327,-0.008836931,0.06460123,-0.033746757,-0.10041217,0.07568024,0.000111133,0.02413878,0.012230068,-0.043364637,-0.016757848,-0.004133571,-0.04703987,0.09516063,-0.07984803,0.009285174,0.030715296,0.0773969,-0.00094481703,0.001096795,0.07150918,-0.08214099,0.013143954,0.0021823428,0.013540861,-0.033104155,-0.06978352,-0.093090974,0.052791353,-0.09111531,0.08868359,-0.046280053,0.0014592817,-0.00400273,0.020317271,0.005151821,-0.0015711962,0.005747643,0.04247784,-0.12395629,-0.0012738178,-0.07127668,0.03075016,0.03305465,-0.0023256012,0.021796795,0.045301482,0.059477527,-0.0009447961,-0.04522372,0.04311958,0.02423022,0.02688049,-0.029833036,0.043131348,-0.005295165,0.055202894,-0.018915482,-0.0015146105,-0.026352895,0.024538541,0.024710396,-0.014375163,0.041265,0.033180308,0.047193263,0.032110397,0.024529064,-0.008143012,-0.03224555,-0.0024069608,0.009547609,-0.034515668,-0.012069529,-0.04058017,0.0030800332,0.009455729,0.032332297,-0.08955489,-0.014228899,0.004678594,-0.081854776,0.0024087464,0.010101942,-0.08803773,0.014746737,0.022811813,-0.044625044,-0.10714793,-0.045138177,0.08530332,0.009916014,-0.074187204,-0.07580017,0.021588994,-0.038103066,-0.100557804,-0.045112647,-0.042847045,-0.075901404,-0.022641242,-0.01043327,1.7109767e-34,-0.020949937,0.06398735,0.005277074,-0.06118367,0.13361998,-0.03935346,-0.0026178304,-0.022248568,-0.07078661,-0.05656244,0.010065314,-0.114559986,-0.062278304,0.027959496,0.043961693,-0.06341761,-0.017689668,0.014099194,-0.099187486,-0.02723149,0.05897874,0.011254909,0.010125445,0.051012006,0.017592257,0.007464266,0.02125485,0.0010506636,-0.02781539,0.030213678,0.007650094,0.028067421,-0.003233738,0.074737914,0.05569667,0.045060635,0.009978673,-0.08759366,0.04684679,0.06331373,-0.0061779707,0.046568807,0.046760187,0.08221269,-0.06693148,-0.03841542,0.022861673,0.12366631,0.09793784,0.01235155,0.0541963,0.04901823,0.09897855,0.026632091,0.034643974,0.0075799422,0.007372549,0.032212812,-0.024224883,-0.10633093,0.06195054,0.058912702,0.025956843,0.03701874,-0.08497684,0.071595594,-0.10255233,0.008094444,0.01811747,0.016371306,-0.025705952,-0.025036667,0.03756364,-0.07493544,0.036160156,0.06846612,0.060433537,0.0317796,0.029334303,-0.044007175,0.019307353,0.07221619,-0.05887553,-0.07668648,-0.0012552574,0.044189207,-0.022713128,0.09542042,0.0440248,0.034734942,-0.031841736,-0.059162192,0.043155886,0.019525502,-0.032065853,7.5164273e-34,0.0017411942,0.027769966,0.07425447,0.016195102,0.014863186,-0.045453414,-0.065266155,-0.010469763,0.047255475,-0.028307056,-0.10513441,0.044643782,-0.015014312,-0.007829835,-0.056781646,0.0631044,0.09878613,0.044938173,-0.02040083,-0.058776934,-0.07278091,-0.0357745,-0.025431987,-0.039682027,-0.036602255,0.046014935,-0.030160766,-0.043514945,-0.0053918054,-0.031057704,-0.07383369,-0.05861243,0.026644856,-0.01205065,-0.0113936765,0.046647485,0.010804769,0.035142276,0.089009814,0.05907465,-0.03201143,-0.05673434,-0.02274574,0.06097491,-0.008054562,-0.08409766,-0.01086227,0.0023267611,-0.060026713,0.1094907,-0.0058050924,0.04681031,-0.033803105,0.038887396,0.015135628,-0.032625657,-0.006640263,-0.00396281,-0.12268108,-0.042836327,0.014482226,-0.025188396,-0.0039848867,0.05410328,0.1309548,-0.002385238,-0.06955889,0.014517975,-0.026934188,0.07256655,-0.03161897,-0.022903962,-0.05505328,0.0074909437,0.10958157,0.003925603,0.022985669,0.006937892,-0.021138389,0.08873724,0.043369755,-0.03835562,0.042701446,-0.055352323,0.018924529,0.03609708,-0.029980874,0.021602154,0.01588857,-0.018836092,-0.022033405,0.0032244679,0.1612803,0.020328753,0.096770145,-3.9217678e-08,0.10040539,-0.10127338,-0.07061783,0.07079912,0.05156044,-0.012042022,-0.09584806,-0.06451229,-0.016242277,-0.03019982,-0.09404934,0.0680906,0.023716047,0.012301023,-0.00859491,-0.039035086,0.027863748,0.01467166,-0.00789272,0.08157556,-0.036516216,-0.003956623,0.03523948,-0.016445523,-0.0028197207,0.043611225,0.046367664,0.011848914,-0.09785902,0.105380856,-0.03495144,0.010980941,-0.06510827,-0.0027627677,-0.0074756537,-0.0001582795,-0.0580876,0.07068948,-0.09720155,0.02257192,0.05954962,-0.008196898,0.006861579,0.06920519,-0.06911737,0.020080574,0.020170543,-0.01062353,0.039933775,0.10467692,-0.025706029,-0.0063141757,0.017193992,-0.026165102,-0.03833794,-0.027077744,0.06893119,0.050266773,0.009406367,-0.033724215,-0.036817133,0.006658588,0.11354044,0.02686248
"Broccoli, this is how I like to prepare it, cutting off the florets like this and I just go around and just cut them all off. 
And then when you get to the center they're a bit smaller but that's okay, you can just cut it like that. Then each one you can just cut through the center and cut them into whatever size you like.",0.08170834,-0.020994717,-0.01678486,0.06089509,0.014335993,-0.09857104,-0.049324863,-0.032292545,-0.03194959,0.016158504,0.014293887,-0.0737551,-0.086628176,0.05932411,-0.008573372,-0.038996734,-0.026276546,0.049024176,-0.0381843,-0.02899729,-0.018933699,-0.08358087,-0.037750337,0.09031032,-0.0027386786,-0.032861236,-0.061570846,-0.02736013,-0.011587179,-0.093556754,0.003361112,-0.02529003,0.07462199,-0.008608004,-0.03855672,-0.066396944,-0.017474152,-0.035092335,0.14367644,-0.02505098,0.08415772,0.039252747,0.07199538,-0.02126077,-0.0034740737,0.021290893,-0.09510543,0.08359701,0.005943812,0.010816993,-0.051497556,-0.07674336,-0.19060475,0.008542336,0.0034718567,0.023972664,-0.10360645,-0.0736399,0.06517913,0.021113558,0.041870654,-0.004958317,0.042716026,0.0014839977,-0.09735113,-0.011159302,-0.019309592,0.05892542,0.002517128,0.022374278,0.0007606661,0.063168764,0.010119978,0.027544865,0.05021547,0.0057876213,-0.06892743,-0.018134506,-0.0027843649,0.09260959,-0.070272036,0.085513435,0.0024375115,0.03517942,-0.03549013,0.047566827,0.021919973,-0.016389787,0.0028791805,0.032922123,-0.0061135218,0.046520703,0.015433709,0.018858729,-0.11311359,-0.034377478,0.032032114,-0.05099656,-0.03652371,-0.020149227,0.009414131,-0.090110846,0.108448766,-0.044886775,-0.045867793,-0.062296867,-0.0380471,-0.03970805,0.06839225,-0.029825974,-0.04140944,0.037894312,-0.053804338,-0.041789643,-0.049921326,0.022465257,0.072761655,-0.043876715,0.052007385,0.059073918,0.008977313,0.0095692575,-0.01832606,-0.051245797,-0.006469844,0.0355657,0.013405873,1.1846294e-33,-0.016114043,0.01278804,0.040456556,0.052511074,0.09044459,-0.031635784,0.036972273,-0.067840464,0.03482626,-0.024777116,-0.029199095,-0.06525376,-0.028498877,0.00082853966,0.072843276,-0.08320377,-0.0027138263,0.037594914,-0.0935677,-0.006237506,-0.045650415,0.027592167,-0.013311897,0.034922764,0.08720165,-0.06511084,-0.017892407,-0.054954097,-0.07875126,0.038792968,0.07361485,0.008003289,0.020694504,0.058738016,-0.030147284,0.0069403546,-0.024831476,-0.08830586,0.0092916945,0.031018177,0.006009984,0.022233142,0.0401198,0.08107743,-0.039925218,0.0018759299,0.06811793,0.15368326,-0.012122433,-0.021343416,0.055344947,0.047921024,0.07949343,-0.025394356,0.033759717,0.03594285,0.048702408,-0.0068773385,0.012840544,-0.0117151365,0.023439176,0.048830487,-0.030837761,0.026101114,-0.035827853,-0.023151942,-0.09769533,-0.0027766633,0.048920363,-0.015265933,-0.043496933,0.011710069,0.049200088,-0.015218547,-0.00620764,0.010756342,0.08106205,0.0382125,-0.06485308,-0.050629817,0.08977489,0.050234593,0.008674051,-0.05302675,-0.04670769,0.00820175,-0.03892601,0.08847373,0.03663793,0.0047441656,-0.026955862,-0.009978367,0.09106564,-0.015468108,-0.04951287,8.77481e-34,-0.0043251626,-0.009949297,0.01467921,0.06489172,0.017396282,-0.014959916,-0.041449536,-0.07246558,0.0046110614,-0.027621817,-0.09811538,0.030706158,0.0332084,-0.068463296,-0.038624078,0.062288895,0.07701069,-0.040809263,0.058492802,-0.022500385,-0.10826732,-0.01595106,0.038361978,-0.053110473,-0.06282964,-0.004177358,0.0033857238,-0.04200203,0.05129842,-0.004958991,-0.09498426,-0.12494264,0.05706549,-0.04334399,-0.012330553,-0.057334423,-0.053217445,0.01747311,0.09938432,0.013027129,-0.020744598,-0.06633882,-0.002487156,0.06523517,-0.0065695625,-0.025674097,0.032921128,-0.018661793,-0.06395953,0.09060485,-0.014266215,-0.0019178988,-0.05561656,-0.043064456,0.03343583,-0.01653973,0.008774631,-0.035616275,0.017151253,-0.003840507,-0.09579162,0.004510954,-0.0048605893,0.0863954,0.06665261,0.054094825,-0.03838203,0.037348807,-0.11954936,0.03123046,0.005492425,0.058714807,0.046340868,-0.012506793,0.022202587,-0.059746087,-0.002100166,0.041766725,-0.006639761,0.09021334,0.04009945,-0.041034743,0.0490908,0.0038840205,0.017074665,-0.0030580976,0.022192424,0.03790254,-0.0016139277,0.10013057,-0.027415607,0.023120098,0.14709905,0.019804485,0.10402917,-3.5166437e-08,0.05289721,-0.074513614,-0.047746725,0.0882136,0.022448005,-0.06361159,-0.07024422,-0.049439188,0.009413857,-0.016713949,-0.038210984,0.09211023,0.015956195,0.034491237,0.017453182,-0.038448915,0.0274695,0.049208578,0.004683008,0.024679244,-0.07287254,-0.019258354,0.062132135,-0.037253924,0.07490553,0.003816053,-0.027205719,0.022405213,-0.00525598,0.05081914,0.012631801,-0.0016658881,0.02772252,0.033320352,-0.02711366,-0.023478447,-0.09521333,0.062449604,-0.053529847,0.040226057,0.023350734,-0.041237578,0.043915756,-0.0033082976,-0.03384083,0.033428285,-0.025435023,0.02777001,0.025810448,0.08828267,0.0067483843,-0.038951796,0.059417922,0.02499898,0.03446507,0.010118746,0.10107156,-0.041015904,0.043102678,0.0057274085,-0.09497035,0.09651375,0.011319645,0.065277986
"So that's the florets. And then the way to use the stem is you need to cut off the sides or the skin and it's hard to do with a peeler. And you kind of need to take off 'cause it's very tough.

- [Audience] Grapes. 
- Would I ever slice a grape? You can slice a grape, I have, and if you're a professional chef, your cooks hate you for it, but if you ever want to slice a grape, get a small paring knife. 
There's two ways you can do it. You can cut along, where the stem is You can also slice it into five slices, but you wanna cut them right before you use them, or else they're just gonna get really weird and slimy.

Just take the stem off, and cut it in half, but look how beautiful the flesh is, and basically everything on this fig is edible, you just gotta be really careful with them because they tend to break up, so if you're gonna put figs on a salad or in a dish, I would cut them and then place them on later on.",0.0697089,0.020879196,0.10129498,0.038099356,0.023231547,0.021454291,0.008134777,-0.009859796,-0.03776879,0.051522367,0.08629221,-0.04753076,-0.03462599,0.046935793,0.03592601,-0.05555701,0.08017954,-0.024049193,-0.052455783,0.0623226,0.07472249,0.041937973,-0.0136342235,0.03143678,0.09835796,-0.024640566,0.06273448,-0.0023768644,0.0018988368,-0.052863102,0.00021743523,0.022529274,0.05539991,-0.024863383,-0.029401807,0.00041941303,0.041601323,-0.088463865,0.07987689,-0.020473091,0.048632998,-0.02327685,0.04576572,-0.028595075,0.032286156,-0.049928468,-0.018055618,0.028642261,0.056016058,0.028940525,-0.04606785,-0.003121234,-0.016998392,-0.034372352,-0.037560187,-0.05722431,0.05725203,-0.08471623,0.0088390475,0.010106623,0.028336154,-0.050022297,0.056098327,-0.0461158,-0.08636061,-0.05627259,-0.0075933672,0.055968862,0.08054352,0.02160274,-0.055853125,0.0040065665,-0.014049022,0.05786456,-0.100843854,-0.044853948,0.012195105,-0.10018749,-0.048504602,0.06559878,-0.052501876,-0.04718963,0.046142418,-0.006815111,-0.059447087,0.06995794,-0.06854516,0.006772618,-0.009144686,0.00789944,-0.03543643,0.03972472,0.08242002,0.11702579,-0.024408136,-0.012738854,-0.0028318178,0.0021664589,0.01881071,0.053199414,0.060546912,-0.043911844,0.017614441,-0.024547344,-0.07408432,-0.03305006,-0.068933,-0.05345719,0.02241294,0.028230911,-0.047031015,0.05640488,-0.091464065,0.021524446,-0.15296863,0.04569556,0.010476884,-0.06023917,-0.037697453,0.042374097,0.03223235,0.025080247,0.041051522,0.09051384,0.04894487,-0.052021205,0.00983344,-9.487794e-34,-0.01106482,-0.00995554,0.025279192,0.028408295,0.05063707,0.018950498,-0.06275068,-0.03805708,-0.055210456,-0.036445312,-0.055628654,0.032288127,-0.082883075,0.079274766,-0.031667765,-0.09009538,0.032765497,-0.011740369,0.027163183,-0.004046918,-0.09469165,-0.004316651,-0.04035851,0.04132605,-0.016051695,-0.025317576,-0.032213803,-0.0021141751,0.065406665,0.01516508,0.09424257,-0.0055826213,0.03669009,-0.08451242,-0.012051868,-0.02069328,-0.068952605,0.026255943,-0.006132067,-0.03731212,0.07380538,0.02077559,-0.006715817,0.09152448,-0.0295799,-0.034667723,-0.071066014,0.05212822,0.06425581,-0.003818961,0.052080687,0.00043800488,0.0114113325,0.019330835,-0.029072657,-0.043311216,-0.0020075126,-0.041369334,-0.093307495,-0.064374305,0.07340413,0.015907615,-0.03727349,0.011990647,-0.083709955,0.036412705,-0.040491488,0.04667482,-0.029136341,-0.07025142,-0.06563954,0.04030699,0.068175584,0.010176868,-0.08128509,-0.034981966,-0.008608433,0.09596856,-0.043214187,0.05071035,0.05732984,-0.023781553,-0.1065504,-0.007021225,-0.026761694,0.03246385,-0.07758079,-0.024680417,0.08084781,0.00902085,-0.08169259,0.04029487,-0.04642731,-0.017437572,-0.0009029395,-8.611416e-34,-0.0204291,0.07035403,-0.021211725,0.103663534,0.013140282,-0.01029744,-0.061921865,-0.008815706,0.00870666,-0.048472542,-0.11397095,0.0051195812,-0.003027608,-0.14183098,0.03373621,-0.0028019128,0.06873805,0.054341998,-0.04246561,-0.01252696,-0.08243611,-0.001648652,0.0057572545,-0.049618043,-0.03882362,0.07760026,0.11980931,-0.053273294,-0.051913563,0.0025108466,0.008179434,-0.098263785,-0.013040002,-0.0674203,0.058880977,0.005291478,-0.061565377,-0.14464886,0.00462529,-0.004198793,-0.06893793,-0.0096069435,-0.033419877,0.03979275,-0.022777328,-0.035223983,-0.006293882,0.017596424,0.027507817,0.008474727,0.019291842,0.020645702,0.03386656,-0.03765396,0.039375853,-0.08272062,-0.0348078,0.039494645,0.0690575,-0.0057729497,-0.019193152,0.030209254,-0.043368567,0.030195251,-0.070976265,-0.042007226,-0.048931085,-0.018407999,-0.049222838,0.05459235,0.008758146,0.06166583,-0.0320033,-0.0132906595,0.008783097,0.007622219,-0.07179087,-0.0012294619,-0.032680646,0.012648585,0.022294989,-0.027874555,-0.0014050279,0.019899547,0.055540208,-0.0053744023,-0.08213021,0.07361742,0.008082912,0.067360274,-0.058355708,-0.07320262,0.013381641,0.115544505,0.021763638,-5.244813e-08,0.10923227,-0.041439623,-0.06252358,0.0053846263,-0.039633807,0.010673409,-0.07461665,-0.008711493,0.0265169,-0.028356377,-0.0036141614,0.08539696,-0.06497394,-0.0031549765,0.032183334,-0.014552945,0.05469881,0.03876441,0.015491238,0.09255123,-0.00055035437,0.028818205,0.103010304,-0.048324045,-0.024456505,0.050493155,0.025903106,0.0599147,-0.009018616,0.0732198,0.08627284,0.033731148,-0.026395682,0.048210237,0.016727714,0.012567661,-0.093157284,0.0063350014,-0.021309111,0.10747059,0.014481836,-0.100225426,0.04350282,0.027772067,-0.09445418,0.039115965,0.052242503,0.038289282,0.020918507,0.09223434,-0.037957273,0.03126395,-0.0736386,0.072544195,-0.10729199,-0.0011231217,0.09791095,0.016063787,0.01103932,0.0074636657,0.005727166,0.008853865,0.010655875,0.0041119913

Cut it in half, put it on the flat side, cut it in half again, and then I usually cut it into little smaller pieces because I'm gonna serve it either on a plate or stuff it in a beer, and that's how you cut a lime.",0.036758166,0.056647237,-0.0071379384,0.014205734,-0.031697795,-0.026279474,0.13146608,-0.016391896,0.013165678,-0.060301542,0.02835938,-0.081365444,-0.035086773,-0.029926583,0.013620185,-0.07396747,0.08268027,-0.014423735,0.003827715,-0.07239246,0.008565824,-0.016152224,0.008429337,0.04783184,0.0038303474,0.02850513,0.016829986,0.02237223,0.062497586,-0.090125956,0.041426945,0.04100051,0.08209349,-0.013512543,-0.037853897,-0.029649358,-0.010471966,0.02063094,0.019901928,0.038346026,0.07729163,-0.021738585,0.023688616,0.024237799,-0.031399556,-0.046322636,-0.024692575,-0.00426611,-0.00189522,0.00842476,-0.0256391,-0.026616605,-0.122642964,0.047713112,0.007432429,-0.0109379385,-0.044427168,0.048426144,0.005232214,0.07491622,0.026421852,-0.04440071,-0.0843866,0.03321889,-0.033555064,-0.050214123,-0.04021561,0.058842838,-0.005384419,0.004697198,0.0013927195,0.014712694,0.017263373,0.020210478,0.021402083,-0.08551187,0.08170921,-0.019767039,-0.0605725,0.020123713,-0.08753464,-0.008516277,-0.035914306,0.023912068,-0.065539725,0.11835922,-0.025352528,0.018414812,-0.037089173,-0.053567294,-0.041734815,0.043150615,0.045923598,-0.027905947,0.039724357,0.04889717,-0.0066062626,-0.08051909,0.040058214,0.023273205,0.07944675,0.04176989,-0.042347692,-0.09343505,0.0135715725,-0.015285589,-0.09082765,0.0649978,0.076189,0.01912133,-0.01302322,0.047528297,-0.015517885,-0.037575096,-0.067529656,-0.017003817,0.03653317,0.0014936074,0.043911826,0.006055207,0.009270056,-0.0035257738,-0.10691692,0.011818871,-0.0048945146,-0.019075228,0.05601104,-5.944488e-33,0.0035995292,0.04669577,-0.0061765783,0.010843126,0.097363666,-0.01806519,-0.0041498956,0.009829961,-0.08346535,0.07499396,0.035223577,-0.09128815,-0.07000457,0.11412361,0.05746837,-0.051152874,-0.034249905,-0.02549501,-0.056737076,-0.11277408,-0.09735582,0.07724866,-0.039624907,0.064839564,-0.03527768,-0.007389867,0.04557826,-0.057192966,0.026547056,0.0009930669,0.0074749594,0.0672671,0.051186156,-0.009664492,-0.0039703236,0.03186577,0.016424501,0.06502957,0.009241174,-0.032386933,0.04301415,0.05503877,0.02422722,0.031288438,-0.022395648,-0.039967943,-0.00043169252,0.045946565,0.021193486,0.049856175,0.05045595,0.023440428,0.10968427,0.05368356,-0.065430015,-0.04500388,0.03729303,0.06358155,-0.06527193,-0.08568386,-0.0013479328,0.07187827,0.029426828,0.051277544,-0.10393511,-0.01855546,-0.08185611,-0.053945564,0.13325317,-0.047871884,-0.099444486,0.050639633,0.014364663,0.011121327,-0.04011503,-0.041766997,0.0077351844,0.017728468,0.06259308,0.010983306,-0.08212057,0.025227232,0.017026875,0.015566354,-0.03927282,-0.0012164783,-0.00442312,-0.06456963,0.042986974,-0.033797447,-0.17955992,-0.0033679216,0.015051067,-0.0001796879,-0.023287863,3.5334905e-33,0.0645109,0.030406138,0.010290448,0.048287384,0.06821992,-0.103541,0.014544858,-0.017080735,0.02768658,-0.043591116,-0.06572102,0.0045097535,-0.008306872,-0.035758622,-0.0033204097,0.0020834855,0.03598355,0.10378866,-0.014872681,0.027716435,-0.18327485,-0.01076901,0.05093003,0.078662716,0.04181043,0.014384426,0.13788097,-0.051164124,0.0019955847,-0.019847706,0.0016189818,-0.1426852,-0.018378371,-0.11286587,-0.031870317,0.02099524,0.016572861,-0.016869081,-0.027220821,-0.0075734197,-0.015975775,-0.035232555,0.01634703,0.11208957,-0.075279556,0.013107466,0.043300956,-0.01788532,-0.1296277,0.06858587,0.08146172,-0.043209594,-0.03235178,0.091227405,0.045448165,0.0153535865,1.9400992e-05,-0.022761444,-0.019548032,0.00919386,-0.052711755,0.0845524,-0.012839853,0.0039289864,0.06570699,0.021898884,-0.016520819,0.039585695,-0.06337903,-0.02335483,0.048407372,0.10620947,0.008416312,0.020994812,-0.046682224,-0.12393084,-0.0077726897,-0.00195818,-0.039994564,0.051058117,-0.01474507,-0.038666707,-0.037222285,0.02842556,0.008794363,-0.00042662307,0.018473422,0.07956111,-0.021960128,0.0340385,-0.014585742,0.010837809,0.07558097,0.036435917,0.016542418,-4.4105583e-08,0.024516353,-0.046326417,-0.102635354,0.04000314,-0.058666684,0.029204426,-0.054195803,-0.047591854,-0.01865045,-0.026360776,0.023639431,0.022589039,-0.04806117,-0.0010791625,-0.01843469,-0.015680902,-0.01457311,0.09586931,-0.01394877,-0.016023213,-0.029292295,-0.00984755,0.057167765,-0.06608361,0.0088285105,0.010927228,-0.0431313,0.05700685,0.07503539,-0.0069241496,-0.00965311,0.059196256,0.007546778,0.006771057,0.08803578,-0.0068779,-0.054896522,-0.0070490167,0.008665504,0.03930353,0.0099258665,-0.07618068,-0.043210816,0.013892654,-0.07047261,-0.045334674,0.0138182035,0.09124564,0.009697347,0.0441725,-0.015339756,-0.02693481,0.041294858,-0.008443715,-0.017690051,0.010439848,0.02008591,0.026664209,0.019680468,-0.06802836,0.057805136,0.13172626,-0.051740136,0.003855148
"- [Audience] Lemon.

"- This is a starfruit. Not much to do to starfruit. Basically, it comes in its own wrapper, you eat the wrapper. 
All you really need to do with the starfruit is slice it. Take the end and the top off. Everything on the starfruit is edible, 
and then you just cut it into slices, you don't even need to worry about the seeds, and you eat it.

"- [Audience] Mandarin orange. 
- This is a mandarin. Usually, what I'll do is I'll just get my thumb in there, right where the stem is, and I'll peel it by hand, and then all you really need to do is pull the sections apart and you eat the sections, nothing else to be done. 
Mandarin.

"- This is a persimmon. It's delicious, but it can also catch you, and if you cut this when it's not ripe, and you eat it, it has a very drying effect on your tongue, and all I do is cut it open. 
When I want to take any stem out, I cut it in half and I make a little bit of a V cut, and then you can just cut this into slices, you can peel it, or you can eat the peel. 
This one looks like it needs to just ripen just a little bit more.

It has a white kind of creamy flesh, and you kinda gotta pull it away from the seeds to eat it.",0.010211495,0.08851438,-0.061601877,0.030745547,-0.023315819,-0.02298438,0.10577027,-0.03238707,0.047031242,0.014962024,0.075537235,-0.09288708,-0.060456358,-0.07522902,0.019343862,0.015080907,0.075553425,-0.06880636,0.06946259,-0.013285237,0.06954545,0.059700496,0.005169491,-0.010334081,-0.021221431,0.042539563,0.028982203,-0.014985439,-0.040890004,-0.09663489,0.014138505,0.011569786,0.0840554,0.03154506,-0.017615292,0.010012984,0.07379078,-0.06633115,0.06455646,-0.038560078,0.069567114,0.06895095,-0.020493792,0.068469174,-0.02690451,0.02264377,0.0056468723,-0.0053204116,-0.0045003914,-0.03060687,-0.06078866,-0.07540314,-0.07674692,0.02222217,0.009586266,-0.0035121315,-0.0004315901,-0.0037046967,0.055139862,0.089353554,-0.011115314,-0.044360515,0.015898209,-0.04117101,-0.042922597,-0.07600137,-0.0011569739,-0.019523557,0.015052141,-0.07503286,0.07212054,0.0656059,0.047733422,-0.023475446,-0.070890285,0.064072445,0.030306002,-0.030275805,-0.105843425,0.04271074,-0.07088343,0.04755178,-0.009588317,0.023784941,-0.04701469,0.019845488,0.015514619,0.009154809,-0.035989948,0.019662818,-0.011363918,0.041239854,0.0104600275,0.053446032,0.030652594,0.011457181,-0.04211426,-0.1511539,0.04818489,0.023162648,0.07848812,-0.02312159,0.024742896,-0.029761348,-0.0065380353,0.0037254416,-0.09276599,-0.019263476,0.08800901,0.06515515,-0.03102982,0.017306589,0.025170438,0.045827284,-0.07407077,-0.07118795,0.04931734,0.032153152,0.025496738,0.04853049,-0.015632724,0.028589115,-0.047162045,0.016346114,-0.017432455,-0.08055741,-0.015001037,-6.156006e-33,0.031010525,-0.049874574,0.09614543,-0.009546873,0.056952447,0.0077596274,-0.055721834,0.011863651,0.0022897704,-0.08600577,-0.06459547,-0.112856716,-0.09150852,0.08352875,-0.010070593,-0.060945943,-0.060094155,0.01690366,0.06446459,-0.008810364,-0.10418517,0.055821933,-0.09533843,-0.035419293,-0.028341765,0.063544236,0.0859811,-0.03092807,0.05806585,-0.0037952068,0.040509243,-0.0321863,0.05993737,-0.0077250656,0.01789187,0.00029008088,0.033380464,-0.026774,-0.088088036,0.013668489,0.011118351,0.015386429,0.049600378,0.039746717,-0.007752368,-0.03103312,0.04287292,0.032772988,-0.0016896133,0.022932237,-0.07900222,-0.029502843,0.08091296,0.0411605,-0.106078155,-0.0023772335,0.038836546,0.029722933,0.021920212,-0.033980723,-0.0048838346,0.056291036,0.008511198,0.018224219,-0.042879872,0.055619933,-0.10703646,-0.004590285,0.02860383,0.09860959,-0.033795584,-0.0255591,-0.0046749515,-0.026968952,-0.028228557,-0.040598743,0.011715961,-0.01310878,-0.07482665,0.011074879,0.06994991,-0.061638396,-0.018564044,0.00020001913,-0.080871545,0.081919655,-0.042300683,0.059156965,0.020839272,-0.021302767,-0.05068403,0.045741573,-0.013855344,-0.027522964,0.008479386,3.6251217e-33,-0.0108854985,-0.027371865,0.039981276,0.017999724,0.065709025,0.02664531,-0.10920375,0.028026886,-0.1358312,-0.072594084,-0.07472112,-0.002527696,0.09184665,-0.048791256,-0.040972333,0.06777664,0.052721314,0.078606606,-0.057281915,0.05532622,-0.16229863,0.0021932777,0.02604071,-0.018484803,-0.036568824,0.028404731,0.068687685,-0.008567291,-0.056995966,0.009663233,-0.0074050426,-0.11175554,-0.042445328,-0.018866766,-0.0047805714,-0.040846594,-0.036164768,-0.09003275,0.001745238,-0.03603037,-0.039354526,-0.0063023083,0.003800118,0.052706573,0.0013882496,0.008777042,-0.024037791,0.08252443,0.006733882,0.10785229,-0.004074357,0.054015014,0.0076444047,-0.041354302,0.082490414,-0.09461544,-0.07230702,-0.03596184,0.05798308,0.004398673,-0.058679078,-0.050374158,0.01466065,-0.0053217844,-0.008734083,0.0060310783,0.04288078,0.10132615,-0.0722294,0.020637505,0.065214284,0.1075785,-0.043821447,-0.02453026,0.022314785,0.078077346,0.0039908513,-0.055345792,-0.009563169,0.032438982,0.025501609,-0.011448685,0.013127689,-0.0037985514,0.027186997,0.03475688,0.012411889,0.083878465,-0.0062225736,0.06846798,-0.015893267,0.041607257,0.05182505,0.008599973,0.02369182,-4.435125e-08,0.04407561,-0.05351706,-0.041499227,-0.012569302,0.038367815,0.01597882,-0.022521442,0.032415662,0.022910086,0.011244733,-0.07750966,0.058506917,-0.063750945,0.054370835,0.0033191594,-0.0058076573,0.09298561,0.02864771,0.049050763,0.033855405,-0.10255087,-0.028341912,0.03964077,-0.06807078,0.0057092705,0.027416654,-0.0016694808,0.02772083,0.050078765,0.031811018,0.013913071,0.061339863,-0.06761396,-0.031360827,-0.02272416,0.08204153,0.010465586,0.0847728,-0.03882098,-0.06432199,0.02505413,-0.04609029,0.01563666,0.00032927928,-0.130372,0.015252488,0.03883129,0.0043669166,-0.064808354,0.047362387,0.050373033,0.034483757,0.05656602,0.020582343,-0.086063944,-0.029826242,0.005217763,-0.088673726,-0.07740579,0.056282684,0.05941462,-0.024841944,-0.0064827385,0.06825646

- [Audience] Apple. 
- This is an apple. Two pieces of equipment, I have a peeler and a knife. 
First thing I do is peel the apple. Take the top off with the peeler, in one round ring.

Freestone peach that I have here, the pit will actually come out just by kind of twisting and a little prying.",-0.012043807,0.05426421,0.03336636,0.06967508,-0.036342558,0.017084064,0.09402168,-0.058197517,0.033621702,0.02423823,0.0014717114,-0.050820604,-0.09745493,0.033919502,-0.014177229,-0.07115881,0.028343843,0.010882665,-0.028786527,-0.0077017294,0.057590466,-0.01175752,-0.040186994,-0.048385065,-0.005624979,-0.01748311,-0.050698187,0.055819582,0.034269273,-0.076249145,-0.047694724,-0.018635033,0.03419909,0.026067154,-0.046907663,-0.087979004,0.01580525,0.020199439,0.026756437,0.016329965,0.033782396,0.042032316,-0.0017586595,0.04403812,0.02988993,0.015749577,-0.08261336,-0.014097309,0.05242067,-0.0585466,-0.07980885,-0.021078944,-0.05811155,0.008305698,0.0027005188,0.02485275,0.007290224,-0.06668488,-0.0036556004,0.07580261,0.0079519935,-0.02543785,-0.0047731693,0.008844587,0.05044279,-0.09265554,0.023861174,0.0047040675,0.03473168,0.041670732,-0.028143235,0.024967097,-0.025809044,0.0011156575,0.008799063,-0.011411944,-0.011817818,-0.037240896,-0.10427035,0.09351021,-0.039519984,-0.018588457,-0.035619162,0.018389275,-0.13044132,-0.002979035,0.017406853,0.034286294,0.020427022,0.033230733,0.028351791,0.056812014,-0.02946987,-0.017080834,0.09081254,-0.032572366,-0.052286018,-0.020626016,-0.035901934,0.03383974,0.027657555,-0.02228764,-0.014171795,-0.027382633,-0.026719898,-0.08990365,-0.0700223,-0.037293848,0.027978173,0.06900045,0.056478675,0.049819846,0.039630543,0.06817756,-0.06441436,0.04321906,-0.04498743,-0.027819302,-0.0068897363,0.083192356,0.017065747,0.019629335,-0.024937367,0.020417891,-0.042439856,0.015795222,-0.067931004,-3.0627623e-33,0.0314459,0.06811252,-0.025741357,0.026755847,0.06977635,0.051756218,-0.0865721,0.0015596673,0.010935777,0.13754092,-0.028488858,-0.041805606,-0.083802305,0.037219644,0.020304859,-0.079232186,-0.06565266,0.014187729,-0.06743444,-0.026760386,-0.0851723,-0.017781757,-0.06356503,0.015180032,-0.06242735,0.010323158,-0.058455892,-0.08310041,0.08070891,-0.005639043,0.046613906,0.035162143,0.031038273,-0.023462247,0.03947118,0.01729686,0.049527854,-0.009535443,0.009171689,-0.057849906,0.03695581,-0.023166234,0.059488066,0.08210137,-0.07653739,-0.15026346,-0.01666017,0.0174923,-0.011203477,-0.035592202,0.055601023,0.0061834194,0.099102505,0.015393933,-0.046511404,0.009077388,-0.02100102,-0.037919637,-0.05106166,0.02717104,-0.016656984,-0.009509442,-0.03380237,0.07190931,-0.07228866,0.054803662,-0.10694486,0.023716945,-0.019272609,0.017159682,-0.06719354,0.032266695,-0.005533019,-0.03895142,-0.13696846,0.017981691,0.045696184,0.057638254,-0.033439446,-0.012725063,-0.004000793,0.05367777,0.034438405,-0.039574478,-0.010111875,0.012398477,0.00021852409,0.025422202,0.10359003,-0.027559843,-0.035717,-0.012592023,0.008512375,-0.07449712,0.0877473,2.3300821e-34,-0.04393028,-0.010639037,-0.0038473657,0.035155747,0.07962715,-0.0065241493,-0.0141403545,0.019947788,-0.0003870875,-0.08304077,-0.12243036,0.080799975,0.11255376,-0.053993054,0.020887539,-0.0059996853,0.0046824645,-0.033679757,-0.07201041,0.023455653,-0.15547916,0.0069797374,0.041532144,0.020780029,-0.047782622,-0.019919002,0.039812665,-0.03299319,-0.022260409,0.009044397,0.032492872,-0.13627033,-0.061639946,-0.01818478,-0.05308958,-0.021082072,0.0270081,-0.035160676,0.02045753,-0.0030488833,-0.06988647,-0.025094109,-0.075250104,0.042639133,-0.002737912,0.080270074,0.06782683,-0.003641823,-0.021969134,0.009417842,0.020951517,0.010505893,-0.0028988856,-0.014668959,0.02162474,-0.05471076,-0.04657394,-0.059497986,-0.037139896,0.034500767,-0.0062375627,0.053762745,0.012902148,-0.018815817,0.03422901,-0.04798949,-0.011782486,0.035720397,-0.07505577,0.03896856,-0.0065982575,0.074608736,-0.016764427,-0.021821534,0.069110185,0.079090655,0.0009150586,-0.015758635,-0.062838405,-0.022792872,0.031124985,0.016960269,-0.01263544,-0.02639095,0.06949564,-0.008163391,-0.012181225,0.068518884,-0.07563093,0.01314071,-0.11205334,0.013283859,0.0827703,0.029922655,-0.042288937,-3.970378e-08,0.058834855,-0.010539461,0.052629974,0.025950523,0.022866629,0.09925912,0.014804872,0.0336324,0.051146224,-0.039414603,-0.11639693,-0.02151122,-0.04397581,0.092380814,-0.021175308,-0.006078654,0.020972194,0.10786464,0.0063372734,-0.028389513,-0.0980823,0.02391357,0.10072427,-0.030078731,-0.031543735,-0.025086189,-0.0026334452,0.015228814,-0.06386938,0.09433865,0.023798417,0.012763955,-0.019365415,0.084184155,-0.009770428,0.054961253,0.025739674,0.0029786655,0.016385322,0.02551011,0.08596267,0.037020758,-0.051749244,-0.008416557,-0.17922564,-0.010222869,0.028479083,-0.0049222116,-0.0227601,0.18146303,0.08218726,0.045232676,-0.009245441,0.055575475,0.06009267,0.026838096,0.082549475,-0.06724017,0.06229706,0.06257397,-0.015522809,-0.009600684,0.06312403,0.025670828
"Clingstone, you kind of have to cut away, and all I do is this, cut it in half with a paring knife, give it a twist, you see the pit comes out, and instead of kind of digging at that and stabbing myself, I'm gonna cut one more time, and pull this away, and then the pit just pulls away. 
Pit goes in the garbage, and then you can slice this however you want. 
If you're gonna do a tart, you can just slice, or you can just eat it out of hand.

"- This is a pomegranate. There's a lot of different ways to process these, I'm gonna show you two ways.

"What we're gonna do is take the top and the bottom off first and then we're gonna peel the orange, trying to hold the shape of it and get all of the pith off.

"The seed, like I said, is gonna be right around there, so I'm gonna cut the edges off. 
Now, with this piece, that's the treat for the chef, you eat it, but this, you cut however you want it, in slices, or in dices. 
Same thing goes for the flesh over here, you can just dice it up or cut it in thin slices, and that's how you cut a mango.",-0.038399898,0.06393095,-0.024931872,0.0202015,-0.041977823,-0.0144637665,0.0069759474,-0.10913529,-0.00089870114,0.060727265,0.080620214,-0.0645407,-0.099975355,-0.04946315,0.051543955,-0.046508852,0.049908537,-0.04005263,-0.051311057,-0.019146442,0.056399185,0.019691495,-0.029604767,0.00985504,0.018578164,-0.0263107,0.028660271,0.03257694,0.026584633,-0.06499638,0.06579222,0.03981277,0.03972559,0.04425598,-0.036464926,0.015025018,-0.00019793215,-0.027566697,0.04398294,-0.03913609,0.13649827,0.043508735,0.049293984,0.03307011,0.045268845,-0.03166142,-0.10471446,-0.0031185583,0.06400911,-0.07435962,-0.16150153,-0.0861872,-0.071073346,-0.056571674,0.00954625,0.029205678,0.08999731,0.057302937,-0.020835942,0.022187863,0.007255386,-0.03024967,-0.03326737,0.004219691,-0.0018112595,-0.12848303,0.03338044,-0.015766917,0.025245616,0.016613312,0.03552183,0.037113816,0.03672087,-0.001665464,-0.053962514,-0.03133169,0.021130828,-0.039027523,-0.073407836,0.065923706,-0.076418616,-0.0026973085,0.013177601,0.0060558696,-0.086346075,0.03410486,-0.012619298,0.012298596,0.051069535,0.020098837,0.053495824,0.0027362811,0.005345216,0.042557176,-0.021755662,0.038561612,0.019358482,-0.11618747,-0.05347867,0.0029053506,0.0033022568,-0.019205775,-0.066109195,-0.02923404,-0.010734555,-0.0073268656,-0.085936286,-0.048482843,0.05960985,0.019266542,-0.019708822,0.07874804,-0.013935797,0.03329756,-0.090958424,-0.04460715,0.052304216,0.036552176,0.06254348,0.048853505,-0.007412129,0.030306585,-0.027430896,0.01144975,-0.024780875,-0.055699993,0.04903098,-5.4451e-33,0.06899354,-0.035100788,0.04620325,-0.0035982358,0.14643183,0.003104839,-0.01721605,-0.046650175,0.010307991,-0.023137895,-0.060813077,-0.11701906,-0.061270796,0.089705095,0.027571023,-0.045289773,-0.036549676,0.018399175,-0.009063062,-0.019562293,-0.071058206,-0.028511787,-0.013618597,-0.039907508,-0.068542235,0.045389697,0.046137314,-0.10493905,0.008695637,0.04198742,-0.0069385357,0.0594089,-0.019162407,-0.04234682,-0.047402576,0.08095874,-0.012464203,-0.03855747,-0.058277816,-0.033637572,-0.007446765,0.021711236,0.029597767,-0.0044094333,-0.07484944,-0.03777423,0.0421892,0.036844973,0.029706199,0.09224761,0.040259756,-0.027855821,0.18208581,0.023003478,-0.029186796,-0.029837452,0.04212523,0.009701102,0.0068884604,-0.015732018,0.074701495,-0.08099822,0.0101656085,0.10059805,-0.07159633,-0.013199362,-0.018995214,-0.037359707,0.022239968,0.0072255256,-0.050677,0.041541398,0.020122413,-0.007666681,-0.08498699,-0.0042603817,0.00018599945,0.041559618,-0.01453097,0.027676182,0.065943986,0.08664532,-0.011641667,-0.114155404,-0.043685135,0.10401369,-0.017439716,0.053429887,0.09574319,-0.025839638,-0.070129834,-0.036909245,0.07150058,-0.041527964,0.041690998,2.3843355e-33,-0.08853163,0.01121682,0.023002036,0.07779598,-0.022711549,-0.06248195,-0.0334998,0.017547727,-0.053201314,-0.041532878,-0.09048792,0.06509582,0.06757505,-0.042106695,-0.017466854,0.0147278,-0.012520965,0.024505328,0.004344051,0.0059140474,-0.10509782,-0.029940033,-0.023444964,0.047287673,0.036895476,-0.0085315285,0.01910031,0.020148298,-0.042827744,-0.054454304,0.07357507,-0.062496986,-0.0822799,-0.05225931,-0.034161855,0.022252288,-0.054751027,-0.017146861,0.05358832,0.04555614,-0.031083615,0.0013849726,-0.040418323,0.034450427,-0.014197561,-0.009088632,0.087783575,0.051397085,0.0031872771,0.0059567187,0.008714252,0.053288415,-0.0358872,0.054267403,0.047678437,-0.064485475,-0.09174548,0.021771427,-0.011480239,-0.06293565,-0.08927336,-0.008901047,0.0019265239,0.03245434,0.027294189,0.07538314,0.09806831,0.04254992,-0.023974655,-0.010822198,-0.030076677,0.07903798,0.028966771,0.0019958832,0.0023237115,0.0035824394,-0.038019907,-0.032495793,-0.060038835,0.033712327,0.028106863,-0.07235793,-0.025609298,-0.016205857,0.0030462132,-0.03686311,0.027443973,0.022862414,-0.05244797,-0.012915415,-0.10895477,-0.018608598,0.04050251,0.05530622,0.06751022,-4.341606e-08,0.068715446,-0.07206196,-0.034418456,0.015499497,0.0088675795,0.0648232,-0.031936582,0.016197948,0.07787886,0.018603055,-0.023263853,-0.057215415,-0.07053965,0.06495273,-0.03587597,-0.023928197,0.021506367,0.09499297,0.0057515046,0.027515225,-0.048309732,-0.026366191,0.05373263,-0.06922317,0.04028892,0.041479643,-0.0723814,0.04302181,0.02386079,0.033288226,-0.017577702,0.033073835,0.065196685,0.118774205,-0.058140807,0.037220232,0.018109014,0.040316835,0.049725346,0.03365286,0.026117515,-0.092322126,-0.02355921,-0.011872213,-0.11197689,0.03057239,0.020019641,0.041396633,-0.100759774,0.06864719,0.00994259,-0.00056794257,0.115634985,0.005510144,0.03650888,-0.029260265,0.038290266,-0.046159334,0.03626421,0.06475395,0.011744711,-0.050401136,-0.01710583,0.039118443
"Here's another way to cut a mango. Don't need to peel it, again, you want to stand the mango up, not lay it flat. You cut close to the seed, on the other side. 
You cut the flesh off on this side. Get a paring knife, I'm just gonna make some crosshatch marks, go one way, I turn it, and I go the other way, and then you can turn it out and pop the mango out and eat it like that. 
Mmm, that's delicious.

"- This is a grapefruit. This is a pink grapefruit, I'm pretty sure it's a pink grapefruit, I don't have x-ray vision, but usually you can see from the skin. 
Similar to most citrus fruits, this is what I would do. Take off the ends, and then I basically peel off the skin, and then you just find the center, and you take out the segments.

"- [Audience] Pineapple.  
This is a pineapple, and this is how you cut a pineapple. We have a couple different ways of doing this, but this is the way that I would do it. 
Take my pineapple, take the top and the bottom off. I lay it on the the flat side and then I'm just gonna peel away the skin. 
I make sure that I go deep enough to get all these little eyes out, so you get most of the eyes off.",0.05260249,0.028180897,0.04951279,0.07295806,0.010474908,-0.020625757,0.08873161,-0.034518745,-0.026889445,-0.01947223,0.032974984,-0.06531904,-0.046015635,0.031263787,0.048307415,-0.01929833,0.006807736,0.030583005,0.025871763,0.06692662,0.0822825,0.024385901,-0.039743356,0.026761979,0.012051559,-0.025226833,0.044323906,-0.042050764,-0.029404303,-0.044439245,0.034478363,-0.037878577,0.031307638,0.058628995,-0.081256725,-0.03241445,-0.008008171,-0.0077811033,0.09008719,0.016565772,0.034339968,0.053952258,-0.021273455,0.03430381,0.041098196,0.029407391,-0.008129886,-0.008535087,-0.0017507431,0.005952062,-0.119791545,-0.07272509,-0.11219253,0.007560861,0.017573485,-0.011819745,0.0028801041,-0.07964524,0.061160274,0.086356945,0.042022597,-0.06305374,0.03686887,-0.0062178513,-0.034645088,-0.067285426,0.029771281,0.016416205,-0.018662654,-0.0050175563,-0.0508669,0.020966535,0.022021893,-0.04420124,-0.087424666,-0.09770373,-0.011776901,-0.0062761027,0.021102926,0.103543594,0.022564298,0.008463167,0.0023762682,0.047169156,-0.0871458,0.049594346,0.0033811461,0.004272454,-0.053809244,0.049330182,-0.0119916,0.0799401,0.04588618,0.026313754,0.0059607243,-0.08053257,-0.06709012,-0.09133964,-0.052012842,0.04507228,0.021208307,-0.09600646,0.015608918,-0.09142717,-0.050920766,-0.03538971,-0.031381667,-0.08422458,0.029170703,0.023145517,-0.0038362904,0.04147064,-0.100759745,0.031793617,-0.03261811,0.043986097,0.08401866,0.015259189,0.03975317,0.0589001,0.023258902,-0.017284654,0.040297195,0.0057579647,0.010558817,-0.023117866,0.023413062,-2.9911387e-33,0.05398275,0.10692304,-0.02711566,-0.0023865877,0.072007485,-0.009812901,-0.055262867,0.035301935,-0.017759165,0.06328714,-0.022473678,-0.12670733,-0.024828834,0.072145194,0.03376422,-0.015236354,-0.018177358,0.0011660351,-0.026443405,-0.07931939,-0.065542154,0.020279752,-0.038460054,0.050961822,-0.12357988,-0.010877414,0.0042897123,-0.12942243,0.06581909,0.013222248,0.045839656,0.05110154,0.012079721,0.017752517,0.04354553,-0.017472792,0.047393914,-0.02364549,-0.023489313,-0.0041384287,-0.011750217,0.032536644,0.010605691,0.055076897,0.01776032,-0.008502887,-0.046206176,0.13507378,0.0038610906,0.05200164,0.016165242,0.0019260788,0.08622631,-0.012337949,-0.04242967,-0.07157254,0.0021550986,0.051756773,-0.02341051,-0.00664245,-0.021936802,-0.0015482211,-0.04292505,0.059696533,-0.11251588,0.03378674,-0.12525028,-0.0031915095,-0.006164378,-0.124466114,-0.045962393,0.015785238,0.037793,0.002928659,-0.12068876,-0.04978789,0.08467002,0.040962532,-0.0051898276,-0.021668738,0.018147834,0.16353768,-0.002489815,-0.07052874,0.023936532,0.024892615,-0.00081535714,0.005071534,0.049655277,0.010504837,-0.042791776,-0.051661238,0.013979666,-0.019584429,0.04020224,2.5793915e-33,-0.022316083,-0.034677006,-0.014638551,-0.03415463,0.01753858,-0.10313737,0.012153435,0.008443603,-0.002752419,-0.03395299,-0.112016134,-0.027466733,0.026333032,-0.01606941,0.012644861,-0.02469702,0.060818247,0.038634304,-0.065136135,-0.016156916,-0.12548918,-0.030775256,0.0057380185,-0.0047889384,-0.02075326,0.06585624,0.10624919,0.012097791,0.079279006,-0.013959948,-0.031722166,-0.09875244,0.009343927,-0.023975905,-0.05582344,0.1149741,-0.104568064,-0.030764794,0.021768797,-0.017634723,-0.06642165,-0.046959262,-0.024673942,0.08656474,-0.0067428127,-0.016122928,0.0011488812,-0.017294593,-0.07715554,0.0035538091,-0.02035911,-0.011340887,0.010667058,-0.0050633755,-0.023022449,-0.0059250896,0.014357566,-0.05611012,0.034429185,-0.01531598,-0.0028222718,-0.0019955637,0.0033139335,0.05110853,-0.0006678815,-0.0051637227,0.0022200767,0.037718922,-0.046490885,-0.014434354,0.0019094896,0.09719116,-0.03269753,-0.030611083,0.022670072,0.018347912,0.020901186,-0.02003577,-0.13570474,-0.008590171,0.047201756,-0.028223973,-0.025941344,0.03413831,0.022170093,0.0058644265,0.04556385,0.07270523,-0.09356122,-0.023256978,-0.06255542,0.011580935,0.086506896,0.08699059,0.047384046,-4.256609e-08,0.04539795,-0.060971513,0.015494792,0.01755708,0.002014045,0.09169631,-0.041387517,-0.010302392,-0.003492584,-0.08976145,-0.06084126,0.05484121,-0.03452265,0.078865215,0.04545614,-0.028349116,0.046306856,0.14302257,0.012708267,0.03214798,-0.07432528,-0.064175494,0.09548963,-0.052233614,0.017624075,-0.0156924,0.0009726978,0.07188788,-0.05524886,0.036626935,0.031547833,0.059831955,-0.06434543,0.08910863,-0.0019604005,0.018907387,0.0023872345,0.0645074,-0.012428132,0.0333777,-0.0026308303,-0.0062885205,-0.028860062,0.06917345,-0.090853296,-0.027623923,0.05379989,-0.030222569,0.027541514,0.10752874,-0.009737115,-0.037776627,-0.027847696,0.09196549,-0.018420646,-0.008849755,0.08842073,0.020405421,-0.034745585,0.06346471,0.019830463,0.081803285,-0.014319143,0.03702038
"I take the pineapple, I split it right down the middle, split it right down the middle again, and I get it into quarters, and right down here in the middle of the pineapple is really fibrous and kind of woody. 
What I'll do is I'll lay it on its side, and take out that center core, so once you get that core out, you can make it into some nice slices. 
I have it nice and flat here, really nice.

"- This is a cantaloupe, and this is how you cut a cantaloupe. In a professional kitchen, you always want to get things flat. 
This is round, it rolls around our board, so I'm gonna first do is cut our ends off, and then I'm gonna peel it with my knife. 
Follow the contour of the cantaloupe, get all the skin off. You don't want any of that green pith. 
It's not bad for you, you're not gonna get sick from it, but it just doesn't taste really good, it's just kind of bland and plain.",0.046339653,0.06432952,-0.02370633,-0.0073164986,-0.03605485,-0.030200794,0.06398624,0.02198099,-0.010665604,0.014445744,-0.021241557,-0.08358502,-0.08809315,0.014096693,-0.016743267,-0.04881285,0.08915264,-0.047822867,0.013835782,0.01754821,0.07873673,0.018312776,0.018658675,-0.026484916,-0.027816098,-0.009279067,-0.0060082804,0.044202343,0.028631138,-0.13171971,0.042558692,0.043220785,-0.043347128,-0.044871997,0.024270028,-0.06070186,0.0045008087,0.034598496,0.03990907,0.012955575,0.036540333,0.05812784,-0.02474577,-0.015579641,0.029965982,-0.020943912,-0.06427085,-0.00054135616,0.077992275,-0.04997109,-6.5240776e-05,-0.059768677,-0.024975246,-0.028220324,-0.00020480214,-0.017282106,-0.03995933,-0.040421933,-0.0015583958,0.049191657,0.035638362,-0.06900027,0.014168049,-0.0020771592,-0.024980403,-0.06598979,-0.050120525,-0.08417988,-0.041159086,-0.041211262,0.013592507,-0.014011463,-0.003529884,0.003121064,-0.009027266,-0.023830863,0.039433047,0.03608624,-0.070397936,0.09758397,-0.017690958,0.069451734,0.0057063876,0.03829192,-0.029430483,-0.027232869,-0.00026617,-0.0018901037,0.006579231,-0.0005131544,0.02220574,0.058393728,0.0077209454,0.031228928,0.009000525,0.013875122,-0.05152362,-0.07063351,-0.04957658,-0.0018813991,-0.023915352,-0.08812037,-0.022385262,-0.11540296,-0.09735772,-0.05988466,-0.011697087,-0.01744663,0.092695594,-0.044174492,-0.07040537,-0.010201533,-0.00048535957,0.04744389,-0.038730625,-0.0015925807,0.13892722,0.013831702,-0.02073877,0.012766048,-0.017296234,-0.044956513,-0.028618282,0.07123217,-0.074615516,0.04430569,0.07668689,-2.4436074e-33,0.04816826,0.15801759,0.03727153,-0.07614839,0.1348974,-0.036368463,-0.023161106,0.010560538,0.020316191,0.05559706,0.025126701,-0.07877656,-0.093379006,0.09788334,0.03989658,-0.040764116,0.0077422024,0.025063757,-0.039800227,-0.029483046,-0.035331972,0.05058755,-0.032327563,0.03446353,-0.041251503,0.028319772,-0.0635075,-0.033150993,0.08141689,-0.0065391557,0.05305395,-0.019261926,0.0194138,-0.019193199,-0.07970139,0.026769115,0.033462625,-0.015531666,0.01848213,-0.0057740486,-0.003456237,0.01106741,-0.018475868,0.02894954,-0.007546507,-0.0287084,-0.014320028,0.06416761,0.0007915365,0.0056959884,0.009072172,0.071728505,0.13614087,0.057452593,-0.050576862,0.0341528,0.036132824,-0.013997966,-0.0069664842,-0.021183437,0.02281042,0.019283239,-0.017333074,0.009734461,-0.113441415,-0.038621258,-0.0742684,0.07369531,-0.02847033,-0.045257222,-0.09323113,0.049401328,0.01418478,-0.039245512,-0.020970719,-0.03945867,-0.034956265,0.068622135,0.06862234,-0.072680354,0.031360757,0.14756031,-0.040787093,-0.054673906,0.0052266982,0.06636461,-0.012331735,0.011569196,0.08833123,0.027713882,-0.0037523813,-0.032146182,0.044981815,-0.0027854217,-0.049060166,1.4030244e-33,-0.028784815,0.025097294,-0.04246697,0.02605848,0.09138173,-0.058099486,-0.08237513,0.052464403,-0.02584,-0.06846382,-0.024939599,-0.06337487,0.051932845,-0.009337147,0.047342885,0.039171405,0.057540894,0.12715322,-0.08955413,-0.11690188,-0.11259858,-0.057502255,-0.013181482,-0.059032485,-0.08420556,0.11557191,0.020476215,-0.057363197,0.04442007,0.048281692,0.022913108,-0.046178132,-0.03965171,-0.08459164,0.052237265,0.06360252,-0.058263175,-0.012026983,0.027309416,-0.016472967,-0.035447728,-0.04361072,-0.0018757358,0.04320838,-0.021952245,0.00080217177,0.031149723,-0.031052884,-0.022055184,0.05039003,0.030360177,0.08226625,0.013938481,0.014334225,-0.028731195,-0.036179937,-0.034735154,-0.05243796,-0.02383747,-0.019067679,-0.024683114,0.0427087,-0.072921455,0.038777735,0.046193913,-0.046512812,-0.03529723,-0.016210899,-0.008149766,-0.009398858,-0.04706911,-0.0069866544,-0.02388025,0.0031380553,-0.009152572,0.032294117,0.04129085,-0.106848486,-0.023100628,0.013204257,-0.063135326,-0.03346245,-0.018216256,-0.024197781,0.029260837,-0.023629662,-0.04376789,0.08630526,-0.030920547,0.024901075,-0.020559665,-0.013502017,-0.0040128035,0.091744855,0.063840315,-5.4893825e-08,0.109646544,-0.123744175,-0.034199964,0.049117632,-0.04913848,0.038503498,0.012333974,-0.04715624,-0.010457891,-0.08114097,-0.023532195,0.06692829,-0.08083038,0.06899627,-0.0422302,0.060016297,0.061126277,0.06659882,0.04483742,0.004239602,-0.13446143,-0.03958944,0.05736685,-0.04831102,-0.031801324,0.037234146,0.033546314,0.08577214,-0.030121434,0.118431605,0.0051981043,0.058400366,0.0006342368,0.13395628,0.028306395,0.007291075,-0.017246824,0.0867289,-0.012968179,0.028876381,0.04842585,-0.0025122606,-0.05146819,0.064222656,-0.09288469,-0.066167586,0.0066397,0.052722834,-0.0068133273,0.08974332,-0.019730177,-0.017518658,0.02178759,0.07034846,-0.0025999274,0.037907135,0.013076145,0.003407314,0.036363766,0.038929127,-0.011171547,0.013319527,0.061748322,0.047036044
"Follow the contour so you get that nice cantaloupe shape. We're gonna cut it in half, and then we're gonna remove all the seeds, and we're just gonna scrape the seeds out, put it on its flat side. 
You can cut these little ends off, those are snacks for you as the chef, and then you slice if you're gonna do a fruit plate, or you can just cut it into slices and leave it like that  or dice it. 
That's how I cut a cantaloupe.

"- This is a pomelo. It's a close cousin to the grapefruit, oranges, it's a citrus fruit. I take the top and the bottom off, make a little bit of a score, not all the way through, but just to break the skin. 
Skin can be used for candying, but the skin and pith tend to be used in the pomelo, as well as the fruit.

barbecue.",0.024730828,0.057046797,0.08591596,0.045624003,-0.03908045,0.00998426,0.02525641,-0.015994983,-0.098792315,-0.025468513,-0.057679083,-0.019465037,-0.09572298,0.052563503,-0.023457725,0.008712985,0.043424115,0.06880022,-0.06548588,-0.0316608,-0.013148452,-0.087252915,0.101222865,0.04864382,-0.0033361495,-0.023183981,0.072464935,-0.005045721,-0.030124335,-0.05428194,0.04784279,-0.019329034,0.012035373,0.025851088,0.01963167,-0.0072316118,0.076911256,-0.08010414,0.069756776,-0.023008984,0.08842843,0.12762457,0.0053197197,0.00076705473,-0.088615045,0.034158517,-0.065227956,-0.023424668,-0.014012646,0.007903426,-0.043929,-0.030422898,-0.0852155,-0.066457465,-0.013019646,0.012133055,-0.03149497,-0.017962182,0.02481634,0.031734206,0.053185213,0.0033957867,-0.004036252,0.014571082,-0.05615875,-0.103650644,-0.015458309,0.036243465,-0.024607964,0.065569416,-0.014930429,0.099393316,-0.036580946,-0.006347149,-0.083338685,-0.033934917,0.034624994,-0.03342431,-0.011064697,0.09273552,-0.08900116,-0.003833486,0.046827167,-0.012833907,-0.11467949,-0.012208625,-0.015799463,0.024806872,0.00095708796,0.06398507,-0.006119091,0.026286356,0.056485225,0.00506913,0.036871716,-0.029675657,-0.021512724,-0.124612615,-0.016072294,0.007933647,-0.014635358,0.028990211,0.07806309,0.00688423,0.08255951,-0.027971376,-0.070945784,-0.045166228,0.027171291,-0.045539934,0.026675973,0.06304845,-0.001221925,0.055373732,-0.051389057,-0.03190977,0.05202366,-0.037793424,-0.0046027764,-0.033859815,0.018576477,-0.046885185,-0.011695943,0.003969981,-0.0037522342,-0.03978564,-0.053489193,-1.7843492e-33,-0.009710159,0.0019935425,0.034181695,0.079903156,0.05712282,0.053886075,0.00036717593,0.0017251545,0.019249022,0.008673552,-0.042868666,-0.06654251,-0.024342533,0.046614546,0.04358145,-0.046313077,0.021354375,0.020204546,-0.11556757,0.03082433,-0.053025506,-0.03449086,0.021011304,-0.01954404,-0.009676503,-0.06993656,0.011687926,0.009545433,0.03250824,-0.011782513,0.057217304,-0.028329926,0.07723147,0.032816727,0.0017015776,0.02155155,0.0984505,-0.014831737,0.0037747216,-0.00055731693,-0.01307487,-0.077660814,0.031843323,0.10138045,-0.07759591,-0.014942924,0.0666732,0.03109775,-0.02602947,-0.004193265,0.009583592,0.020239659,0.06771136,0.019014006,-0.030699458,0.023594573,0.02419913,-0.037190847,0.029122857,-0.017483477,0.027725255,0.0031486752,-0.036960907,-0.008909076,-0.05392935,-0.0010370902,-0.031003589,0.0274416,0.03703432,-0.024406446,-0.06657111,0.037813827,-0.014894991,0.023103338,-0.06139143,0.030773215,0.091817945,0.0034517732,0.0145785,-0.011711595,0.073575705,0.1356605,0.012598819,0.029595561,-0.0563156,-0.017554823,-0.052221,0.040958185,0.05658198,0.08014551,-0.07587388,0.006846074,0.084884405,-0.056790993,0.017459081,7.4851926e-34,-0.015088944,-0.052186307,-0.046578854,0.030505352,0.064896494,-0.015875781,-0.008841654,0.025938364,0.008596017,-0.073790886,-0.058538657,-0.044039052,-0.026986163,-0.09019981,0.07478927,-0.02067816,0.07375053,0.027162056,-0.021554386,-0.051982746,-0.13741955,0.0023180295,0.029477073,0.01667301,-0.05456412,0.037571304,0.023114394,-0.09529598,-0.030610502,0.009251777,-0.046693943,-0.13794214,0.035155352,-0.0220681,0.0648341,0.023783684,-0.12692805,-0.04083981,-0.0037217808,0.03518584,-0.011054003,-0.05176108,-0.07015561,0.086017914,0.029822247,0.067435935,0.09400018,-0.015812507,-0.020648139,0.08954599,0.013154801,0.021513341,-0.0014918982,0.040772278,0.09244943,-0.07149908,-0.0057138996,-0.09133146,0.07305828,0.015538146,-0.03447867,0.013921013,-0.012506378,-0.008010969,-0.046196498,-0.039594103,0.0070021683,0.003880886,-0.03084055,-0.04058237,-0.010305534,0.10612324,0.011644881,-0.011036862,0.034786496,0.030247899,-0.028027661,-0.07547971,-0.06255252,0.014077439,-0.020107783,0.04979543,0.013639334,-0.019518223,0.06540304,-0.062516466,-0.03642082,0.049015384,-0.078265116,-0.001019016,-0.029481234,-0.03797569,0.061931796,0.09055637,0.023191689,-4.637329e-08,0.028101904,-0.030277934,-0.020031799,-0.007048287,-0.0022512006,0.053759895,0.032481972,-0.02598309,-0.016853021,-0.0649741,-0.029717688,0.011556502,-0.09375038,0.08261697,-0.109667115,-0.047849458,0.028528059,0.11805911,0.01608224,0.1148905,-0.09360747,-0.027858589,0.0005608294,-0.029406734,-0.059337094,0.054631,-0.059309095,0.07414216,-0.0030345912,0.045314785,0.0903306,0.01285827,-0.003906269,0.12701167,0.008005218,-0.044240482,0.041761838,0.050889857,-0.0828488,0.0062653203,0.013712945,0.012146406,0.010070048,0.04160763,-0.08166031,-0.054316703,0.03563377,-0.017920077,-0.02459968,0.1439918,-0.003020066,0.02524955,-0.050128274,0.029715447,0.031299368,-0.03918689,0.0783084,-0.11614999,-0.08156657,0.06784533,-0.028400078,0.058050167,-0.011688625,0.06083181
"You can cut it one more time if the watermelon's really big but then you just cut it into slices. 
So, what you can also do, if you want, is after you have your slices, you can do a little cross cut here, take these little edges off, so that when you eat it, you don't get that watermelon on your face, it'll give you a cleaner bite, and it looks like a little house.
